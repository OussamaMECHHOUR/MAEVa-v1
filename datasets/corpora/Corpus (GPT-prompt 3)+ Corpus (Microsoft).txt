Tillering: Approximately 3-4 months after sowing, the sugarcane plants begin tillering. Tillering refers to the formation of side shoots or tillers from the primary shoot. These tillers will eventually grow into mature stalks. 3. Vegetative growth: Sugarcane plants continue to grow vegetatively for several months after tillering. During this stage, the plants develop an extensive root system and grow taller, with leaves and shoots increasing in size. 4. Flowering: Unlike some other crops, sugarcane rarely produces flowers. Instead, it's primarily propagated through stem cuttings. Therefore, the flowering stage is not significant in traditional sugarcane cultivation. 5. Fructification: Around 10-12 months after planting, sugarcane plants begin to mature and reach the fructification stage. At this point, the stalks thicken and store high levels of sugar. It is during this period that the sugarcane is ready for harvesting to extract sugar or can be allowed to continue growing for more extended periods if used for other purposes, such as biomass. It's important to note that the time of fructification can vary depending on various factors such as climate, variety of sugarcane, soil conditions, and cultural practices. Additionally, some modern sugarcane varieties are bred to have shorter maturation periods, allowing for quicker fructification and higher yields. As a data scientist, you can collect specific data related to various sugarcane varieties, climatic conditions, and cultivation practices to study and predict fructification periods accurately. 

Emergence in thermal time refers to the stage in the growth and development of a crop, such as sugarcane, based on the accumulation of thermal units or heat energy. Thermal time is commonly measured in degree-days or growing degree-days (GDD), which represents how much heat has accumulated above a certain base temperature. For sugarcane, the base temperature is typically considered to be around 0Â°C. This means that any temperature below 0Â°C is not considered to contribute towards thermal time accumulation. To calculate the thermal time or GDD for emergence in sugarcane, you would subtract the base temperature (0Â°C) from the average daily temperature and accumulate these values over time. The formula for calculating GDD is as follows: GDD = (Max Temperature + Min Temperature) / 2 - Base Temperature The GDD values are accumulated over a certain period, typically from planting to emergence, to track the progress of sugarcane growth. Once the accumulated GDD reaches a certain threshold, emergence occurs. It's important to note that the optimal temperature range for sugarcane growth is between 24Â°C and 30Â°C. Temperatures above 30Â°C can cause heat stress, while temperatures below 24Â°C may slow down growth and development. In addition to thermal time, other factors such as soil moisture, soil fertility, sunlight, and disease control also play crucial roles in sugarcane emergence and subsequent growth. Proper management practices incorporating these factors are essential for successful sugarcane cultivation. 

Flowering in thermal time refers to the ability of a crop, such as sugarcane, to flower based on accumulated thermal units or heat. The base temperature of 0Â°C is crucial as it indicates that flowering will only occur when the temperature exceeds this threshold. In sugarcane cultivation, the flowering process is essential for successful seed production and continuation of the crop cycle. However, it's important to note that not all sugarcane varieties or cultivars flower, as many modern commercial varieties are bred to be sterile or have reduced fertility. The flowering in sugarcane is directly influenced by thermal time accumulation, or the duration of exposure to temperatures above a certain threshold, known as the base temperature. In this case, the base temperature is set at 0Â°C. When the accumulated thermal time or heat units reach a certain level, the plant reaches the critical point for flowering. This critical point may vary depending on the sugarcane variety or cultivar. It's worth mentioning that flowering can be influenced by several factors, including genetic and environmental conditions. The photoperiod, or day length, can also play a role in triggering flowering in sugarcane. Some varieties may require specific day lengths to initiate flowering, especially if they are photoperiod-sensitive. To monitor flowering in sugarcane based on thermal time, farmers and researchers use various methods. One common approach is to calculate the accumulated thermal time by tracking the daily temperatures above the base temperature over a certain period. This can be done using weather data and mathematical models. By monitoring thermal time, farmers can estimate the potential flowering time and plan their management practices accordingly. This information is vital for determining the appropriate timing for activities such as seed production, harvest, and crop rotation. It's important to note that the flowering process in sugarcane can be complex and influenced by various factors. Therefore, it is advisable for farmers to consult with agronomists or crop specialists who have a deep understanding of the specific sugarcane varieties being cultivated and their flowering behavior. 

Fruccitification in thermal time is a concept used to measure the development and maturity of crops, including sugarcane, based on accumulated thermal units or heat degrees. It determines the growth stages and time taken for specific physiological processes to occur in plants. Thermal time is calculated by considering the daily average temperature above a specified base temperature, which in this case is 0Â°C. Each crop has its own base temperature requirement, which represents the minimum temperature below which growth and development are not considered. For sugarcane, fructification is the process by which the plants develop and mature their sugar-rich stalks or canes. It involves the accumulation of sugars and the growth of the cane to its optimal size and sugar content before harvesting. The thermal time requirement for fructification in sugarcane can vary depending on various factors such as the sugarcane variety, climate conditions, and other agronomic practices. Different studies and experiments have shown fructification thermal time ranges from approximately 2000 to 3200 degree-days for sugarcane crops. Degree-days or thermal units are calculated by summing the daily average temperatures above the base temperature over a specific period. The accumulated degree-days can be estimated by using temperature data and formulas such as the Growing Degree Day (GDD) method or the Modified Growing Degree Day (MGDD) method. To track fructification progress in thermal time, you would need to monitor average daily temperatures and calculate the accumulated degree-days throughout the growing season. By comparing the accumulated thermal time with the known range for fructification in sugarcane, you can assess the crop's growth and maturity stage. Understanding fructification in thermal time can assist in decision-making processes related to crop management, such as determining the optimal time for harvest, implementing pest and disease control measures, and assessing yield potential. It is important to note that while thermal time provides a useful indicator for crop development, it should be considered in conjunction with other growth indicators such as visual observations and plant physiological measurements for accurate assessment and decision-making. 

The Index of Aboveground Coverage (IAC) is a metric used to quantitatively measure the amount of vegetation cover or biomass present in a particular agricultural field or natural area. It indicates the proportion of ground covered by the aboveground parts of plants, typically expressed as a percentage. In sugarcane cultivation, maintaining optimal aboveground coverage is essential for achieving high yields. The IAC of sugarcane fields determines the efficiency of solar radiation interception, water use, nutrient uptake, and overall plant growth. It provides valuable insights into plant health, canopy development, and crop management practices. The calculation of the IAC involves capturing aerial or satellite imagery of the sugarcane field. This imagery is typically taken in the form of remote sensing data. Advanced techniques like Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or similar algorithms are then used to analyze the imagery and estimate the amount of vegetation cover. The resulting IAC value can range from 0% to 100%, where 0% indicates no vegetative cover, and 100% represents complete coverage. Higher IAC values generally indicate healthier and more productive crops, as it implies a greater capture of sunlight and efficient use of available resources. Farmers and agronomists utilize information derived from the IAC to make informed decisions regarding irrigation, fertilization, and pest management. By monitoring changes in the IAC over time, farmers can identify areas of the field that may require additional attention or intervention. It's important to note that the exact methods of calculating the IAC may vary depending on the specific remote sensing technology used and the desired level of accuracy. Additionally, different crops and agricultural practices may have slightly differing interpretations or terminology associated with aboveground coverage metrics. 

Maximum coverage refers to the concept of utilizing the available land area to its fullest capacity, optimizing the cultivation of crops and maximizing productivity. In the context of sugarcane cultivation, maximum coverage involves effectively planting sugarcane in a manner that covers the maximum available land area to achieve high yields and profitability. Here are some important factors to consider for achieving maximum coverage in sugarcane cultivation: 1. Land Preparation: Prior to planting sugarcane, the land should be properly prepared to ensure optimal coverage. This includes clearing weeds, rocks, and debris, as well as tilling and leveling the soil. 2. Planting Techniques: Selecting the appropriate planting technique is crucial to achieving maximum coverage. The two main methods used in sugarcane cultivation are using setts (stem cuttings) and planting whole canes. Sett planting provides better coverage as multiple setts can be planted in a single row. 3. Spacing and Row arrangement: Proper spacing between plants and rows is important to maximize coverage and promote healthy growth. The spacing can vary depending on the variety of sugarcane and soil fertility, but typically ranges between 1.2 to 1.5 meters between rows and 0.6 to 0.9 meters between plants within a row. 4. Crop Density: Higher crop density promotes maximum coverage and can potentially increase yields. Planting sugarcane at a higher density helps to utilize the available land area more efficiently. However, the density should be carefully determined based on the variety, soil fertility, and available resources. 5. Weed and Pest Management: Effective weed and pest control measures are essential for maximum coverage. Uncontrolled weed growth can compete with sugarcane plants for nutrients, light, and space, reducing coverage and productivity. Timely herbicide application, manual weeding, and integrated pest management practices can help maintain maximum coverage. 6. Irrigation and Nutrient Management: Providing adequate water and nutrients is crucial for maintaining healthy and vigorously growing sugarcane plants, which in turn contribute to maximum coverage. Proper irrigation scheduling and balanced nutrient application based on soil test results help optimize plant growth and coverage. 7. Proper Harvesting Techniques: Harvesting sugarcane at the right stage of maturity is important for maximum coverage. Timing the harvest correctly ensures optimum utilization of the land area and prevents plant lodging (falling over), which can reduce coverage and yield. 8. Crop Rotation and Ratoon Management: Implementing crop rotation practices and effectively managing ratoons 

The maximum plant height of sugarcane can vary depending on several factors such as the variety of sugarcane, the climate, soil conditions, and management practices. Generally, sugarcane plants can reach heights ranging from 2 to 6 meters (6.5 to 20 feet). The specific variety of sugarcane plays a significant role in determining the maximum plant height. Some varieties are known to grow taller than others. For instance, commercial varieties like Co 997, Co 86032, and Co 86028 can attain heights of 4 to 6 meters (13 to 20 feet). On the other hand, certain dwarf or compact varieties may have a maximum height around 2 to 3 meters (6.5 to 10 feet). Climate also affects the growth and height of sugarcane plants. Sugarcane is a tropical and subtropical crop that thrives in warm and humid conditions. In regions with favorable climates, sugarcane plants have the potential to grow taller due to prolonged growing seasons and optimal growing conditions. Soil conditions and fertility also contribute to the maximum height of the sugarcane plant. Well-drained soils with adequate moisture and high organic matter content promote healthy plant growth. Nutrient-rich soil, especially with an adequate supply of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, supports optimal plant growth and can contribute to taller plant heights. Lastly, proper crop management practices like appropriate spacing between plants, timely irrigation, regular fertilization, and weed control can influence plant height. Providing optimal conditions and care throughout the growing season can help the sugarcane plants reach their maximum potential height. It is important to note that these maximum plant height ranges are just estimates, and actual plant height may vary depending on the specific conditions and management practices implemented on the farm. Monitoring the growth of the plants and making appropriate adjustments to optimize growth will ultimately determine the plant height achieved. 

Radiation use efficiency (RUE) is a crucial concept in agriculture, specifically in crop production. It refers to the efficiency with which plants convert solar radiation into biomass through photosynthesis. More specifically, RUE measures the amount of dry matter produced by a plant per unit of intercepted solar radiation. In the context of sugarcane cultivation, RUE plays a significant role in determining crop productivity. Sugarcane, a C4 plant, is highly efficient in converting solar energy into biomass due to its efficient photosynthetic machinery. Factors Affecting Radiation Use Efficiency: 1. Crop Type: Different crops have varying RUE values, primarily due to differences in their photosynthetic pathways. C4 plants such as sugarcane typically exhibit higher RUE compared to C3 plants like wheat or soybeans. 2. Leaf Area Index (LAI): LAI is a measure of the leaf surface area per unit ground area. It represents the canopy's efficiency in intercepting solar radiation. A higher LAI allows more absorption of solar radiation, thus increasing RUE. 3. Solar Radiation Availability: Adequate solar radiation is essential for optimal crop growth and high RUE. Cloud cover or shading from neighboring plants can reduce the amount of available radiation, resulting in lower RUE. 4. Temperature and Water Availability: Temperature and water availability influence plant growth, photosynthesis rates, and RUE. Optimal temperature and adequate water supply promote higher RUE, while extreme temperatures or water stress can decrease efficiency. Improving Radiation Use Efficiency in Sugarcane Cultivation: 1. Crop Management: Proper crop management practices, including optimizing planting density, fertilization, and irrigation, can enhance RUE. Maintaining an appropriate LAI throughout the growing season is crucial to maximize solar radiation interception. 2.

The growth rate in height of sugarcane plants can vary depending on several factors such as climate, soil conditions, variety, and farming practices. Typically, sugarcane plants experience their most rapid growth during the first few months after planting. Here are some key points to consider: 1. Initial Growth: After planting sugarcane stalks or setts, the plants usually take around 3 to 4 weeks to sprout and emerge from the soil. During this period, little above-ground growth can be seen. 2. Early Growth: Once the plants have emerged, they start developing leafy shoots. In favorable conditions, sugarcane can grow rapidly, with an average height increase of about 30 to 60 cm (12 to 24 inches) per month. This vigorous growth phase typically lasts for the first 4 to 6 months after planting. 3. Vegetative Growth: During the vegetative stage, the sugarcane plants continue to grow taller and produce more leaves. Under optimal conditions, the plants can grow at a rate of 2.5 to 5 cm (1 to 2 inches) per day, reaching a height of 2 to 6 meters (6.5 to 20 feet) within a year. 4. Growth Factors: Several factors affect the growth rate of sugarcane. Adequate sunlight, warm temperatures (between 20-30Â°C or 68-86Â°F), and consistent moisture levels in the soil promote faster growth. Soil fertility and nutrient availability also play a crucial role in supporting healthy and vigorous growth. 5. Fruiting and Ripening: Once the sugarcane plants reach their maximum height and have undergone a specific number of leaf cycles (varies by variety), they enter the reproductive stage. At this point, the focus shifts from vegetative growth to sugar accumulation in the stalk. The height growth significantly slows down, and the plants begin to allocate resources for flowering and seed formation. It's important to note that these growth rates are general estimates and can vary based on specific growing conditions and cultivars. Monitoring the growth rate and adjusting farming practices accordingly can optimize sugarcane yield and quality. 

Leaf appearance rate (LAR) is a crucial parameter in sugarcane cultivation. It refers to the rate at which new leaves emerge and expand in a sugarcane plant over a specific period. LAR is an essential metric for assessing the growth and development of sugarcane crops and is influenced by various factors such as temperature, light, water availability, nutrient supply, and genotype. LAR is typically measured by determining the number of newly emerged leaves per unit time. The most common unit of measurement is the number of visible dewlaps (expanded leaf blades) per plant per day. A dewlap is considered visible or emerged when it reaches approximately half its maximum length and has an open leaf blade. The Leaf Appearance Rate Index (LARI) is another term used to describe leaf emergence in sugarcane. LARI represents the average number of newly emerged leaves on a specific date relative to the date of planting. It is calculated by dividing the total number of emerged leaves at a particular point in time by the number of days since planting. Factors Affecting Leaf Appearance Rate (LAR) in Sugarcane: 1. Temperature: Sugarcane growth is influenced by temperature, with optimal growth occurring within a specific range (around 20-30Â°C). Extreme temperatures, either high or low, can negatively impact leaf appearance rate. 2. Light: Adequate sunlight is crucial for the photosynthesis process, which directly affects leaf emergence and growth. Insufficient light can lead to reduced leaf appearance rate. 3. Water Availability: Moisture is vital for sugarcane growth, and water deficiency or excess can affect leaf emergence. Adequate irrigation and proper drainage are important to maintain optimal water levels. 4. Nutrient Supply: The availability of essential nutrients is critical for sugarcane growth and development.

The longer the growing season, the higher the potential for biomass accumulation. 5. Harvest timing: It is important to consider the optimal time for harvest to maximize aboveground dry mass. Sugarcane is typically harvested when the sucrose content of the stalks is at its highest, but delaying the harvest too long can result in reduced biomass accumulation due to aging and detaching of leaves. To accurately determine the maximum aboveground dry mass of sugarcane, it is recommended to conduct field trials or refer to data from agricultural research institutes or studies specific to your region or sugarcane variety. These sources can provide insight into expected biomass yields and the factors influencing them. 

The leaf dry mass per aboveground dry mass is a measurement used to determine the proportion of dry mass that the leaves contribute to the total aboveground dry mass of a plant or crop, in this case, sugarcane. This ratio is often used to evaluate the vigor and productivity of plants, as it can indicate the efficiency of photosynthesis and the overall health of the crop. The higher the leaf dry mass per aboveground dry mass ratio, the more productive and efficient the crop is considered to be. Factors such as nutrient availability, water supply, and environmental conditions can influence this ratio. Adequate nutrition and optimal growing conditions can promote the development of a higher leaf dry mass per aboveground dry mass ratio in sugarcane, leading to increased biomass and ultimately higher sugar yields. To determine the leaf dry mass per aboveground dry mass ratio in sugarcane, you need to measure or estimate the dry mass of the leaves and the total aboveground dry mass of the plant. This can be done by collecting a representative sample of leaves and the aboveground biomass, drying them in an oven or using an infrared dryer, and weighing them to obtain their respective dry mass. The leaf dry mass per aboveground dry mass ratio is then calculated by dividing the dry mass of the leaves by the dry mass of the entire aboveground biomass: Leaf dry mass per aboveground dry mass = Leaf dry mass / Aboveground dry mass This ratio can be expressed as a decimal or as a percentage. For example, if the leaf dry mass is 500 grams and the aboveground dry mass is 2000 grams, the leaf dry mass per aboveground dry mass ratio would be: Leaf dry mass per aboveground dry mass = 500 g / 2000 g = 0.25 or 25% This means that the leaves contribute 25% of the total dry mass of the aboveground parts of the sugarcane plant. By monitoring and optimizing the leaf dry mass per aboveground dry mass ratio, farmers and researchers can make informed decisions and adjust crop management practices to maximize the productivity and efficiency of their sugarcane cultivation.

It is an essential nutrient for crop growth and plays a crucial role in various physiological processes within plants. Here is some important information about exchangeable magnesium: 1. Importance for Plants: Magnesium is a vital nutrient for plants as it is a component of chlorophyll, the pigment responsible for photosynthesis. It is crucial for the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the energy currency of plants. Magnesium also plays a role in enzyme activation, protein synthesis, and nutrient uptake. It helps in maintaining appropriate pH levels within plant cells and influences the carbohydrate and starch metabolism. 2. Soil Availability: Magnesium is present in the soil in either exchangeable or non-exchangeable forms. Exchangeable magnesium refers to the fraction of magnesium ions (Mg2+) that are loosely bound to the soil's cation exchange complex. It is easily released into the soil solution, making it available for plant roots to uptake. The non-exchangeable magnesium is tightly bound to soil minerals and not directly accessible to plants. 3. Soil Testing: Soil testing is an essential tool to determine the exchangeable magnesium levels in the soil. It provides valuable information about its availability to plants and helps farmers and agronomists make informed decisions regarding fertilizer recommendations. The soil test results typically express exchangeable magnesium as milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) of soil or parts per million (ppm). 4. Deficiencies and Excesses: Magnesium deficiency can lead to various symptoms in plants, including yellowing between the veins of older leaves (interveinal chlorosis), stunted growth, and lower yields. It is a common issue in acidic soils, sandy soils, or soils with high potassium or calcium levels. Conversely, excessive exchangeable magnesium can also cause nutrient imbalances and negatively affect plant growth. However, magnesium toxicity in plants is relatively rare. 5. Correction of Imbalances: If a soil test reveals low exchangeable magnesium levels, corrective measures can be taken to address the deficiency. This may include the application of magnesium-rich fertilizers such as magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts) or dolomitic lime, which contains both calcium and magnesium. It is important to follow agronomic recommendations based on soil test results to ensure precise nutrient management. 6. Crop-specific Requirements: Different crops have varying magnesium requirements. For instance, crops such 

Exchangeable sodium refers to the amount of sodium (Na) ions present in the soil that are available for exchange with other cations, such as calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and potassium (K). It is an important parameter in soil analysis and is measured in terms of milliequivalents per 100 grams of soil (meq/100g). Sodium is one of the essential nutrients required for plant growth, but excessive amounts can negatively affect soil structure and plant health. High levels of exchangeable sodium can lead to soil degradation and formation of a condition called "sodic soil" or "sodium-affected soil," which has adverse effects on agricultural productivity. When the level of exchangeable sodium exceeds the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the soil, it can cause several problems. The excessive sodium disrupts the balance of other essential cations, mainly calcium and magnesium. This disrupts the structure of soil aggregates, reducing water infiltration rates, increasing soil erosion, and resulting in poor soil drainage. In terms of sugarcane cultivation, exchangeable sodium plays a significant role since sugarcane is a salt-sensitive crop. Excess sodium in the soil affects root development and function, leading to reduced nutrient uptake and impaired water uptake by the plants. This can result in stunted growth, reduced cane yield, and poor quality of sugarcane produced. To manage exchangeable sodium and prevent soil sodification, farmers may employ various strategies: 1. Soil testing: Regular soil testing helps determine the levels of exchangeable sodium in the soil, allowing farmers to take appropriate measures. 2. Soil amendments: The addition of amendments, such as gypsum (calcium sulfate), can help replace exchangeable sodium with calcium, improving soil structure and reducing the negative effects of excessive sodium. 3. Drainage management: Proper drainage systems can prevent waterlogging and leach out excess sodium from the soil profile. 4. Irrigation water management: Monitoring the quality of irrigation water is crucial. High-sodium irrigation water can contribute to increased soil sodium levels. Using proper irrigation techniques and adopting water management practices can minimize sodium buildup in the soil. 5. Crop rotation: Including salt-tolerant crops in the rotation can help alleviate the effects of high soil sodium levels. These crops can extract excess sodium through their deep root systems, improving soil conditions for subsequent sugarcane crops. By effectively managing and monitoring exchangeable sodium levels in the soil, farmers can ensure optimal growing conditions for sug

Grain yield at harvest per unit area is a measurement used to determine the productivity of a crop in terms of grain production. It is typically measured by harvesting the crop from a specific area of the field, excluding the border areas, and then weighing the harvested grain. The weight is reduced to 14% moisture content to ensure uniformity and accuracy in comparing yields across different conditions and locations. The moisture content of harvested grain can vary depending on several factors such as weather conditions, cultivation practices, and the specific crop being harvested. To standardize the measurement and eliminate the moisture effect on yield, the weight of the grain is adjusted to a standardized moisture content of 14%. The process of reducing the grain weight to 14% moisture content involves drying the harvested grains. This is done using various methods such as sun drying, mechanical drying, or a combination of both. By reducing the moisture content to a specific level, it allows for fair and consistent comparison of grain yields, irrespective of the initial moisture content. The reason behind reducing the grain weight to 14% moisture content is that it represents the typical moisture level at which grains are stored and traded. Most grain crops are stored and transported at moisture levels close to 14% to minimize the risk of spoilage, insect infestation, and deterioration in quality during storage. For accurate comparison and analysis of grain yields, it is important to use the weight of the harvested grain reduced to 14% moisture content. This standardized measure allows for consistent evaluation of field performance and facilitates comparison between different farms, regions, or even different years. As a data scientist, it is crucial to work with standardized and reliable data, including grain yield at harvest per unit area reduced to 14% moisture content. This standardized measure enables better analysis, decision-making, and comparisons in the field of agricultural research and farming practices.

Digestibility of the non-starch and non-glucide components of stover, such as the cell wall, is an important factor to consider when assessing the overall quality and nutrient value of sugarcane as a feed source for livestock. The cell wall, also known as the fibrous portion of plants, is composed of complex carbohydrates like cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose, and pectin. Assessing the digestibility of the cell wall in sugarcane stover involves measuring the breakdown of these complex carbohydrates by the enzymes present in the digestive system of animals. The higher the digestibility, the easier it is for livestock to extract nutrients from the stover, and the more valuable it is as a feed source. There are several methods to assess the cell wall digestibility of sugarcane stover. One commonly used method is the in vitro or in situ technique, where a sample of the stover is incubated with rumen fluid or enzyme preparations to simulate the digestion process. The amount of cell wall components that are broken down or released during this incubation period is measured to calculate the digestibility. Another approach is to use chemical analyses to estimate the cell wall composition of the stover, including its cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose contents. By determining the proportion of each component, an estimation of the overall digestibility can be made. Researchers and scientists also use advanced techniques like near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) to predict the cell wall digestibility of sugarcane stover. This non-destructive method analyzes the molecular structure of the stover, and with the help of calibration models, can provide fast and accurate predictions of its digestibility.

This will determine the dry weight of the sugarcane biomass for each plot. 7. Calculation: Calculate the above-ground dry biomass at the plot level by subtracting the initial weight (fresh weight) from the final weight (dry weight). This will provide the dry biomass in kilograms for each individual plot. Additionally, it is important to consider certain factors for accurate measurements: - Randomization: Randomly selecting the plots prevents biased sampling and ensures representativeness. - Plot size: Standard plot sizes for sugarcane biomass measurement range from 1-10 square meters. Smaller plots may give more precise results but larger ones provide a general overview. - Replication: Replicate the measurements across multiple locations within your field to account for natural variations. - Data recording: Maintain proper documentation of the plot identification, fresh weight, and dry weight for each sample to preserve traceability and facilitate analysis. - Calibration: Regularly calibrate the weighing scales to maintain accuracy. By following these steps, you can measure above-ground dry biomass at the plot level in sugarcane cultivation. This data will help you make informed decisions about crop management, assess productivity, and contribute to scientific research in the field of sugarcane agriculture. 

The above-ground fresh biomass in sugarcane cultivation refers to the total weight of the plant material (leaves, stalks, and tops) present above the ground surface in a specific plot area. It is an important metric used to estimate the overall yield and productivity of sugarcane crops. There are several methods commonly used to measure above-ground fresh biomass at the plot level. These methods can vary in accuracy, complexity, and time required. Some of the commonly used methods include: 1. Harvesting and weighing: This is a straightforward and accurate method where the entire sugarcane crop in a specific plot is manually harvested, and the fresh biomass is weighed using a balance. It provides a direct measurement of the biomass, but it can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. 2. Sampling and destructive harvest: In this method, a representative sample is collected from the plot area. The collected sample is then manually harvested, and the fresh biomass is weighed. This method is less time-consuming than the first method but still requires labor and can affect the crop. 3. Non-destructive measurements: Non-destructive methods aim to estimate fresh biomass without damaging or removing the plants. These methods can involve several techniques, such as the use of remote sensing technologies (e.g., LiDAR, hyperspectral imaging) or plant canopy sensors (e.g., using optical sensors or infrared thermography). These methods provide estimates based on the correlation between the measured parameters and actual biomass, but they require specialized instruments and may have limitations concerning accuracy and cost. 4. Biomass prediction models: In some cases, predictive models can be used to estimate the above-ground fresh biomass based on easily measurable parameters such as plant height, stem diameter, leaf area, or leaf chlorophyll content. These models are developed using empirical relationships between these parameters and measured biomass from previous studies. It is important to note that the choice of method depends on various factors including the level of accuracy required, available resources (time, labor, equipment), and the scale of the study. Each method has its own advantages and limitations, and the selection should be based on the specific research or farming objectives. 

The Crude Protein concentration of the WAB, also known as Whole Aerial Biomass, refers to the amount of protein present in the entire above-ground part of the sugarcane plant, including leaves, stalks, and panicles. Crude Protein concentration is an important parameter to consider in sugarcane farming as it directly impacts the nutritional value and quality of the crop. The Crude Protein concentration of the WAB can vary depending on various factors, including the variety of sugarcane, growing conditions, and crop management practices. On average, the Crude Protein concentration of WAB in sugarcane ranges from 4% to 10%. However, it should be noted that these values are approximate and can vary widely. To determine the Crude Protein concentration of the WAB accurately, laboratory analysis is required. The most common method for determining Crude Protein is the Kjeldahl method, which involves digesting the sample with sulfuric acid and then measuring the nitrogen content, as proteins contain roughly 16% nitrogen. Maintaining an optimal Crude Protein concentration in the WAB is essential for both forage and bioenergy purposes. High protein concentrations are desirable for livestock feed as it provides better nutrition for animals. In contrast, lower protein concentrations are often preferred for bioenergy production, as it leads to higher sugar content for ethanol production. It is worth mentioning that other parameters such as fiber content, moisture content, and mineral composition also play a vital role in determining the overall nutritional quality of sugarcane. Hence, considering these factors in conjunction with Crude Protein concentration provides a comprehensive understanding of the WAB's nutritional value. 

Dead aboveground dry matter refers to the plant material that has become dead and dried out above the ground level. In the context of sugarcane cultivation, it primarily includes the leaves, stems, and other residues of the sugarcane plant after it has been harvested or during senescence. Here are some key points about dead aboveground dry matter in sugarcane: 1. Composition: Dead aboveground dry matter consists of the non-living parts of the sugarcane plant, such as the leaves, stalks, sheaths, and other plant residues. These components are typically dried out and no longer actively functioning within the plant. 2. Harvesting residue: After sugarcane is harvested for its stalks, the remaining parts of the plant, including the leaves and upper portions of the stems, constitute the dead aboveground dry matter. This residue is often left on the field since it helps protect the soil from erosion and provides organic matter for subsequent crops. 3.

Weighing: Weigh the above-ground biomass and the root biomass separately using a sensitive scale. It is preferable to weigh the fresh biomass immediately after collection to prevent drying or loss of moisture. 5. Calculation: Calculate the ratio of above-ground biomass to root biomass by dividing the weight of above-ground biomass by the weight of root biomass. The formula is as follows: Ratio = Weight of above-ground biomass (g) / Weight of root biomass (g) For example, if the above-ground biomass weighs 500 grams and the root biomass weighs 200 grams, the calculation would be: Ratio = 500 g / 200 g = 2.5 Therefore, the ratio of above-ground biomass to root biomass (fresh) would be 2.5. Note: It is important to mention that this ratio can vary depending on the specific purpose of your study or analysis. The above method provides a general calculation for determining the fresh ratio, but for more accurate results, it is recommended to collect multiple samples from different locations in your field and perform statistical analysis. This will help account for any spatial variations and provide a more representative estimation of the ratio. 

I'm sorry, but I am not familiar with the acronym "UFL" as it relates to sugarcane cultivation or farming. It seems that the term may not be commonly used in the agricultural field or specific to sugarcane farming. Can you please provide more information or clarify what "UFL" stands for in this context? This will help me provide you with the relevant information you are looking for. 

The frequency index of application of herbicide is a measure used to determine the number of times herbicides are applied to a specific crop or area over a given period. It helps in determining the intensity and frequency of herbicide use for controlling weeds in sugarcane cultivation. 1. Why is herbicide application important in sugarcane cultivation? Herbicides play a crucial role in weed management in sugarcane cultivation. Weeds can reduce crop yield by competing for essential nutrients, water, and sunlight. By applying herbicides, farmers can selectively target and control weeds, thus reducing their negative impact on sugarcane growth and maximizing crop performance. 2. Factors influencing the frequency index of herbicide application: a. Weed species composition: The type and density of weeds present in the sugarcane field can influence the frequency of herbicide applications. Fields with more aggressive weed species may require more frequent herbicide treatments. b. Weed pressure: The severity of weed infestation affects the frequency of herbicide applications. Higher weed pressure may necessitate more frequent treatments. c. Herbicide efficacy: The effectiveness and persistence of the herbicide used also influence the frequency of application. Some herbicides have longer residual activity, reducing the need for frequent treatments. d. Cropping system: The type of cropping system, such as single or ratoon cane, can affect the frequency index. Ratoon cane may require fewer herbicide applications due to reduced weed emergence. 3. Integrated Weed Management (IWM) practices: To reduce the reliance on herbicides and minimize the development of herbicide-resistant weeds, farmers can adopt integrated weed management strategies. These may include: a. Crop rotation: Rotating sugarcane with other crops can disrupt weed life cycles, reducing the need for herbicide applications. b. Mechanical weed control: Incorporating mechanical methods like hand weeding, hoeing, or using specialized machinery can help keep weed populations in check. c. Cultural practices: Proper land preparation, timely planting, optimum nutrient management, and ensuring crop vigor can suppress weed growth. d. Biological control: Introducing beneficial organisms like weed-eating insects or using cover crops that suppress weed growth can complement chemical weed control. 4. Tracking frequency index of herbicide application: To track the frequency index of herbicide application, farmers can maintain detailed records including: a. Date of herbicide application b. Herbicide name and dosage applied c. Field 

The rate of increase in ground cover by sugarcane plants can vary depending on various factors such as climate, soil conditions, variety of sugarcane, management practices, and stage of growth. However, I can provide you with general information on the typical rate of ground cover by the plant. Sugarcane is a dense and fast-growing crop that is known for its ability to create an extensive ground cover. Here are some key points to consider: 1. Rapid Establishment: Sugarcane typically establishes ground cover relatively quickly, especially during the first few weeks after planting. Under favorable conditions, it can start covering the ground within a month. 2. Stooling and Tillering: Sugarcane plants have a unique growth habit called "stooling" and "tillering." Stooling is the process of producing new shoots or "stools" from the base of the plant, while tillering refers to the growth of additional shoots from the main stalk. These processes contribute to the rapid increase in ground cover. 3. Leaf Area Expansion: Sugarcane plants have broad leaves that efficiently capture sunlight for photosynthesis. As the plants grow, the size and number of leaves increase, resulting in a greater ground cover. 4. Canopy Closure: Sugarcane canopies tend to close rapidly, especially during the later stages of growth. Canopy closure occurs when the leaves of adjacent plants overlap, reducing the amount of bare ground between them. It helps to suppress weed growth, conserve moisture, and provide shade for the soil. 5. Interrow Spacing: The rate of ground cover can be influenced by the spacing between sugarcane rows. Narrower interrow spacing can lead to faster ground cover compared to wider spacing as there is less bare ground between adjacent rows. It is important to note that the rate of increase in ground cover may vary depending on the specific variety of sugarcane, management practices such as weed control and fertilization, and prevailing climatic conditions. Regular monitoring and adaptation of management strategies can help optimize ground cover establishment for optimal growth and yield. 

Leaf appearance rate per plant is an important parameter in sugarcane cultivation as it directly relates to the leaf area index (LAI) and overall plant health. Leaf appearance rate measures the rate at which new leaves are being produced by individual sugarcane plants. The leaf appearance rate is commonly expressed as the number of new leaves that emerge per plant per day. This can be determined by calculating the difference in leaf count over a specified time period, typically in days. Factors Affecting Leaf Appearance Rate: 1. Age of the plant: Younger plants generally have a faster leaf appearance rate compared to older ones. 2. Variety: Different sugarcane varieties have varying leaf appearance rates depending on their genetic characteristics. 3. Temperature and climatic conditions: Optimal temperatures (around 20-30Â°C) promote faster leaf emergence, while extremes can slow it down. 4. Nutrient availability: Plants deficient in essential nutrients may exhibit slower leaf appearance rates. 5. Water availability: Adequate water supply is necessary for sugarcane growth and leaf production. Monitoring and Evaluation: To measure the leaf appearance rate, select a representative sample of plants within the sugarcane field. Count the number of leaves on each plant and record the count. After a designated period (e.g., one week), count the new leaves that have emerged and calculate the rate by dividing the increase in leaf count by the number of days. It is important to keep in mind that leaf appearance rate can vary throughout the growing season due to changing environmental conditions and crop management practices. Regular monitoring and evaluation of leaf appearance rate can help identify any issues affecting plant growth and enable timely corrective measures to be taken. Leaf appearance rate data can be analyzed in correlation with other agronomic parameters such as yield, sucrose content, and stalk diameter to identify trends and establish relationships. This information can then be used to optimize management decisions, such as irrigation scheduling, nutrient application, and pest control, leading to improved sugarcane productivity. 

The Index of weed control efficiency based on weed ground cover is a numerical measure used to assess the effectiveness of weed control methods in managing weed populations in sugarcane cultivation. This index provides an indication of how well a particular weed management strategy is suppressing or reducing weed ground cover in a given area. To calculate the Index of weed control efficiency based on weed ground cover, the following steps can be followed: 1. Weed ground cover assessment: Conduct a visual survey of the area under consideration to estimate the percentage of ground covered by weeds. This can be done using a point quadrat or frame grid method where random points or grids are placed in the field, and the presence/absence of weeds is recorded. The total area covered by weeds is determined as a percentage. 2. Pre-treatment ground cover assessment: Before applying any weed control measures, determine the initial weed ground cover prior to implementation. This serves as a baseline for comparison. 3. Post-treatment ground cover assessment: After implementing weed control measures (e.g., herbicide application, manual removal, cultivation), conduct a follow-up assessment to determine the remaining weed ground cover. This is usually done a specific period after the treatment, depending on the weed growth rate and the effectiveness of the control method. 4. Calculation of weed control index: The Index of weed control efficiency is calculated using the following formula: Weed Control Efficiency (%) = ((Pre-treatment weed ground cover - Post-treatment weed ground cover)/Pre-treatment weed ground cover) * 100 The result obtained will be the percentage of weed control that has been achieved with the implemented method. Higher percentages indicate better weed control efficiency. It is important to note that the time interval between pre and post-treatment assessments can vary depending on the weed species, growth stage, and the specific weed control method used. Regular monitoring and assessment are necessary to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of weed management strategies and to make appropriate adjustments if needed. 

The Index of Weed Control Efficiency based on weed dry mass is a quantitative measure used to evaluate the effectiveness of weed control methods in agricultural practices, specifically in sugarcane cultivation. It provides insights into the effectiveness of weed management strategies in reducing weed biomass and competition with the sugarcane crop. To calculate the Index of Weed Control Efficiency based on weed dry mass, you need to follow these steps: 1. Begin by selecting a representative sample area in the sugarcane field where weed control measures have been applied. Ensure that the sample area is randomly chosen to obtain unbiased results. 2. Collect the weeds from the sample area, making sure to collect all the different species present. 3. Thoroughly clean the collected weeds to remove any debris or soil particles that may be attached. 4. Dry the cleaned weed samples in an oven or under sunlight until a constant weight is achieved. This ensures that all moisture content has been evaporated. 5. Weigh the dried weed biomass using a balance, and record the weight in grams. 6. Repeat the entire process for another sample area that has not undergone any weed control treatment. This will serve as the control/reference area. With the collected data, you can now calculate the Index of Weed Control Efficiency based on weed dry mass using the following formula: Index of Weed Control Efficiency (%) = [(Control Weed Dry Mass - Treated Weed Dry Mass) / Control Weed Dry Mass] x 100 In this formula: - Control Weed Dry Mass refers to the average dry mass (in grams) of weeds from the control/reference sample area. - Treated Weed Dry Mass refers to the average dry mass (in grams) of weeds from the sample area where weed control measures were applied. The Index of Weed Control Efficiency provides a percentage value, indicating the reduction in weed biomass achieved through the implemented weed management practices. A higher index value signifies a more effective control of weeds in the sugarcane cultivation area. This information can be utilized by data scientists and researchers to analyze and compare the efficiency of various weed control techniques, assess the impact of different herbicides or cultural practices, and make informed decisions regarding weed management in sugarcane cultivation. 

The number of days to reach 50% of seed emergence in days since sowing can vary depending on various factors such as the variety of sugarcane, weather conditions, soil fertility, and seed quality. However, on average, it takes around 15 to 25 days for sugarcane seeds to reach 50% emergence after sowing. To promote proper germination and emergence, it is essential to ensure that the seeds are sown at the right depth and under favorable conditions. The ideal soil temperature for sugarcane germination ranges from 20 to 30 degrees Celsius. It is also important to note that achieving 50% seed emergence is only an initial milestone in the sugarcane cultivation process. The crop requires additional care and management practices, such as irrigation, weed control, fertilizer application, and pest and disease management, to ensure optimum growth and yield. 

The number of days to reach 50% of plant flowering in days since sowing can vary depending on various factors such as the variety of sugarcane, climate conditions, soil fertility, and cultivation practices. However, on average, it takes around 240 to 270 days for a sugarcane plant to reach 50% flowering after sowing. It is important to note that sugarcane is a perennial crop and it typically takes 10-18 months from planting to reach full maturity for harvest. Flowering in sugarcane is not desirable for commercial cultivation because it can reduce the yield and sugar content of the crop. To optimize sugarcane cultivation, farmers often use vegetative propagation methods like stem cuttings or meristem culture, rather than relying on the flowering and seed production process. These methods ensure the genetic characteristics and traits of high-yielding varieties are maintained throughout the cultivation process. Additionally, farmers employ various farming techniques and practices to promote healthy growth and development of the sugarcane plants, such as proper irrigation, timely nutrient application, weed control, and pest management. By following these practices, farmers can maximize yield and overall production efficiency. 

The number of days to reach 50% of plant fructification (also known as flowering or fruiting) in sugarcane cultivation can vary depending on various factors such as the variety of sugarcane, climate conditions, soil fertility, and farming practices. However, typically, it takes around 180 to 210 days for sugarcane plants to reach 50% fructification from the day of sowing. It's important to note that this is a general estimation, and the actual number of days can vary. Additionally, it's worth mentioning that fructification in sugarcane is a gradual process, with individual stalks maturing at different rates. 

The sum of degree days from sowing to reach 50% of seed emergence is a measure used in agriculture to determine the accumulated warmth required for seeds to germinate and emerge from the soil. It considers the base temperature, which is the minimum temperature below which seed germination does not occur. To calculate the sum of degree days, you need to know the daily temperature data and the number of days since sowing the seeds. Here's how you can calculate it: 1. Determine the base temperature: In this case, the base temperature is 0Â°C (also known as the threshold temperature). 2. Obtain the daily temperature data: Measure and record the temperature (in Celsius) each day from the day of sowing until seed emergence. 3. Calculate the average daily temperature: Sum up the daily temperatures and divide the sum by the number of days recorded. This will give you the average daily temperature. 4. Calculate the degree days for each day: For each day, subtract the base temperature from the average daily temperature. If the result is negative, count it as 0. 5. Sum up the degree days: Add up all the degree day values calculated for each day from sowing to seed emergence. This sum will give you the sum of degree days from sowing to reach 50% of seed emergence. Note that the base temperature of 0Â°C is commonly used as it represents the temperature below which most crop seeds do not germinate. However, different crops may have different base temperatures, so it's important to consider the specific crop you are cultivating and its optimal germination temperature. Additionally, factors like soil moisture, seed quality, and planting depth can also influence seed emergence and germination time. 

The sum of degree days from sowing to reach 50% of plant flowering is a concept used in agricultural science to measure the heat accumulation required for a crop, specifically sugarcane in this case, to reach the flowering stage. It is calculated based on the concept of growing degree days (GDD) which takes into account the daily average temperature during the growth period. Degree days are calculated by subtracting the base temperature (in this case, 0Â°C) from the average daily temperature, and then summing up these values over a specific period. For sugarcane, the base temperature of 0Â°C is used because it is the minimum temperature required for growth and flowering. To calculate the sum of degree days from sowing to reach 50% of plant flowering, you would follow these steps: 1. Determine the average daily temperature for each day during the growing period, starting from the sowing date. 2. Calculate the degree days for each day by subtracting the base temperature (0Â°C) from the average daily temperature. 3. Sum up the degree days for each day until the plant reaches 50% flowering. Here's an example to illustrate the calculation: Let's assume the average daily temperatures during the growing period for sugarcane were as follows: - Day 1: 10Â°C - Day 2: 12Â°C - Day 3: 15Â°C - Day 4: 18Â°C - Day 5: 20Â°C Using these average daily temperatures, we can calculate the degree days as follows: - Day 1: 10Â°C - 0Â°C = 10 degree days - Day 2: 12Â°C - 0Â°C = 12 degree days - Day 3: 15Â°C - 0Â°C = 15 degree days - Day 4: 18Â°C - 0Â°C = 18 degree days - Day 5: 20Â°C - 0Â°C = 20 degree days To find the sum of degree days from sowing to 50% flowering, you would sum up these values until the flowering stage is reached and reach 50% of the desired degree days. Please note that the specific heat requirements for sugarcane to reach 50% flowering may vary depending on the variety and growing conditions, so it would be best to consult local agricultural resources or research studies for more accurate and specific information. 

The sum of degree days from sowing to reach 50% of plant fructification (base temperature of 0Â°C) is a measure used in crop cultivation to estimate the time taken for plants to reach a certain stage of fruiting. It is calculated by summing the degree days above a base temperature of 0Â°C from the sowing date until 50% fructification is achieved. Degree days are a way to quantify the accumulated heat energy that plants receive over a period of time. They are calculated by subtracting the base temperature (in this case, 0Â°C) from the average daily temperature and summing up the values over the desired period. To calculate the sum of degree days for a specific crop like sugarcane from sowing to 50% fructification, you would need to: 1. Determine the base temperature: In this case, it is 0Â°C. 2. Record the average daily temperatures: Measure the daily temperatures from the sowing date until 50% fructification is reached. It is important to use accurate temperature data for reliable calculations. 3. Calculate the degree days: Subtract the base temperature (0Â°C) from the average daily temperature. If the average temperature is below the base temperature, consider it as 0. Sum up the values for each day to calculate the total degree days. 4. Determine the stage of 50% fructification: Monitoring the crop's growth and observing when it reaches the 50% fructification stage. 5. Sum the degree days: This is the sum of all the calculated degree days from the sowing date until 50% fructification is achieved. It represents the accumulated heat units during this period. The sum of degree days can help farmers predict the timing of important stages in the crop's growth cycle, allowing them to plan irrigation, fertilizer application, and harvest timing. It provides valuable insights for optimizing crop management practices and maximizing yield. 

The maximum apex height of a sugarcane plant can vary depending on various factors such as the variety of sugarcane, soil fertility, climate conditions, and agronomic practices. On average, the maximum apex height ranges between 2 to 5 meters (6.5 to 16.4 feet) during the growth period. However, under ideal conditions and with proper management, some sugarcane varieties can reach heights of up to 6 meters (20 feet) or even taller. It is important to note that excessive plant height can lead to lodging, making the crop more susceptible to lodging-related losses during strong winds or heavy rainfall. Therefore, prudent agronomic practices, such as timely inter-node pruning or reducing excessive nitrogen application, can help manage plant height for better crop performance and yield. 

Global radiation use efficiency is an important parameter in agricultural systems, especially for crops like sugarcane. It is a measure of how efficiently a plant converts the incoming solar radiation it receives into aboveground dry mass, which is an indicator of plant productivity. Here is some relevant information about this topic: 1. Definition: Global radiation use efficiency (RUE) is defined as the amount of dry biomass produced per unit of global solar radiation intercepted by the crop during a specific period of time. It is usually expressed in units of grams of dry biomass per megajoule of intercepted radiation (g/MJ). 2. Measurement: RUE can be determined by measuring the aboveground dry biomass and the total amount of global solar radiation intercepted by the crop. The dry biomass can be harvested from a known area within the field, dried to a constant weight, and then weighed. The intercepted solar radiation can be estimated using instruments such as pyranometers or calculated using models based on weather data. 3. Factors Affecting RUE: Several factors influence RUE in crops such as sugarcane: a. Crop Species and Variety: Different crops and varieties have varying levels of inherent radiation use efficiency due to differences in photosynthetic characteristics. b.

It helps in evaluating the effectiveness of different management strategies, optimizing resource allocation, and monitoring the impact of environmental conditions on plant growth. 5. Variation in RUE: RUE can vary among different crops, varieties, and environmental conditions. It also varies throughout the growing season, with higher RUE early in the season and lower RUE as the crop matures. 6. Enhancing RUE: Farmers can improve RUE by implementing various practices such as optimizing crop planting density, ensuring proper crop nutrition, providing adequate water management, optimizing pest and weed control, and selecting appropriate crop varieties. 7. Modeling RUE: RUE can be integrated into crop models to simulate and predict crop 

The rate of increase in height of sugarcane plants varies depending on various factors, including the variety, growing conditions, and management practices. On average, sugarcane plants can grow anywhere between 2 to 4 centimeters per day during the peak growing season. Here are some key points to consider: 1. Growth stages: Sugarcane has several growth stages, including germination, tillering, grand growth, maturity, and ripening. The rate of height increase is highest during the grand growth phase. 2. Variety: Different sugarcane varieties have varying growth rates, with some being faster growers than others. It's important to choose the right variety based on your local climate, soil conditions, and purpose of cultivation. 3. Climate and environmental conditions: Sugarcane prefers warm tropical and subtropical climates. The growth rate can be affected by factors such as temperature, sunlight exposure, rainfall, and soil moisture. Optimal growth conditions can enhance the rate of height increase. 4. Soil fertility and nutrition: Adequate soil fertility is crucial for healthy sugarcane growth. The availability of essential nutrients, particularly nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients, can directly influence the growth rate. Regular soil testing and proper fertilization practices are necessary to ensure optimum growth. 5. Water management: Maintaining proper water levels is essential for sugarcane growth. Adequate irrigation or rainfall is crucial to maintain soil moisture levels, especially during critical growth stages. Insufficient water supply can hinder the growth rate. 6. Crop management: Appropriate crop management practices, including timely weed control, pest and disease management, and adequate spacing between plants, can support optimal growth rates. 7. Harvesting: The rate of height increase gradually slows down as the plant reaches maturity. The time of harvesting is important to ensure maximum sucrose accumulation and yield. 8. Plant health: Regular monitoring for pests, diseases, and nutrient deficiencies is essential to maintain plant health. Unhealthy plants may experience stunted growth and slower height increase. It's important to note that these factors interact with each other, making it essential to create a well-balanced environment for optimal sugarcane growth and maximize the rate of height increase. 

The maximum aboveground dry mass observed during sugarcane plant growth is an essential variable in understanding the plant's productivity and biomass accumulation. It represents the total amount of dry matter or biomass obtained from the aboveground parts of the plant, including the stalks, leaves, and inflorescence. The aboveground dry mass is influenced by various factors, including genetics, environmental conditions, agronomic practices, and crop management. Here are some key points to consider: 1. Genetic Factors: Different sugarcane varieties or cultivars have varying potentials for aboveground dry mass accumulation. Certain varieties are bred for high biomass yield and have a genetic advantage in producing more dry matter. 2. Environmental Conditions: Climatic factors, such as sunlight, temperature, rainfall, and soil moisture, significantly impact aboveground dry mass. Sugarcane plants require sufficient sunlight for photosynthesis, a moderate temperature range (20-35 degrees Celsius), and adequate water availability for optimum growth and biomass production. 3. Agronomic Practices: Proper agronomic techniques and nutrient management play a crucial role in maximizing aboveground dry mass. Adequate soil preparation, timely planting, appropriate spacing, irrigation, and fertilization are necessary for promoting healthy plant growth and biomass accumulation. 4. Crop Management: Regular monitoring and management of pests, diseases, and weeds are essential to minimize their negative impact on plant growth and biomass production. Implementing good agricultural practices, such as proper harvesting techniques, also ensures maximum biomass retention. 5. Harvesting Stage: The stage at which sugarcane is harvested affects the maximum aboveground dry mass observed. Plants should be harvested at the optimal maturity stage, considering sugar content, biomass yield, and environmental conditions, to gain the highest dry mass. 6. Time of Measurement: The maximum aboveground dry mass can vary depending on the duration of plant growth and the time of measurement. The plants continue to accumulate biomass until reaching maturity, after which the dry mass may stabilize or slightly decline. It is worth noting that the actual maximum aboveground dry mass observed may vary among different regions, cultivars, and management practices. Regular monitoring and documenting of aboveground dry mass during plant growth can provide valuable insights into the productivity and biomass potential of sugarcane crops, aiding in decision-making for cultivation practices and crop improvement. 

The number of fertilization applications in sugarcane cultivation can vary depending on factors such as soil fertility, nutrient requirements, and agronomic practices. Generally, farmers apply fertilizers multiple times throughout the growing season to ensure optimal growth and yield. Here are some key points regarding the number of fertilization applications in sugarcane farming: 1. Basal Fertilization: Before planting sugarcane, farmers typically apply a basal or pre-planting fertilizer application. This is done to provide the initial nutrients required for early crop establishment. The exact composition and quantity of basal fertilizers depend on soil nutrient levels and fertilizer recommendation based on soil testing. 2. Split Fertilization: Sugarcane is a long-duration crop that requires nutrients at different growth stages. Farmers commonly adopt a split fertilization approach, dividing the total recommended amount of fertilizer into multiple applications throughout the crop cycle. This helps to meet the plant's nutrient demand at different growth stages. 3. Planting Fertilization: In addition to pre-planting basal fertilization, farmers may also apply fertilizers at the time of planting. This practice helps to provide immediate nutrient availability for early growth and establishment of sugarcane seedlings. 4. Stool Fertilization: Sugarcane plants develop multiple shoots known as "stools." Farmers often apply fertilizers near the base of these stools during the early stages of growth to promote healthy and vigorous shoot emergence. 5. Ratoon Crops Fertilization: Sugarcane can be grown for multiple cycles or "ratoons" after the initial harvest. For ratoon crops, it is essential to consider residual nutrients from the previous cycle. Farmers may adjust the fertilizer application rates based on soil nutrient levels and crop requirements to avoid nutrient imbalances and ensure sustained productivity. 6. Foliar Fertilization: Apart from soil application, foliar fertilization is occasionally used in sugarcane cultivation. Foliar sprays involve the application of liquid fertilizers directly to the leaves. This method allows for the rapid absorption of nutrients and is often used to provide trace elements or supplement specific nutrient deficiencies. It is crucial to note that the exact number of fertilizer applications and their timing may vary based on regional practices, local conditions, and specific fertilizer recommendations for sugarcane cultivation. Farmers often consult agricultural extension services, agronomists, or agricultural research institutes to develop a customized fertilization plan based on their crop's specific needs and nutrient requirements. 

The application rate of soil enrichers, such as fertilizers or organic amendments, depends on various factors including the specific enricher, the soil type, the crop being grown (in this case, sugarcane), and the current nutrient status of the soil. Here's some general information regarding the application rate of soil enrichers for sugarcane cultivation: 1. Soil Testing: Before determining the application rate, it is crucial to perform a soil test to assess the nutrient levels and pH of the soil. This analysis helps in identifying any deficiencies or imbalances and provides recommendations for enricher application. 2. Macronutrients: Sugarcane requires various macronutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). The application rates for these macronutrients are often given in terms of their percentage contents in fertilizers. For instance, a common recommendation for a sugarcane crop may be to apply 100 kg of N, 50-75 kg of P2O5, and 100-150 kg of K2O per hectare. 3. Micronutrients: Besides macronutrients, sugarcane also needs micronutrients like zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), etc. The application rate for these micronutrients is typically much lower compared to macronutrients. Again, soil testing helps to determine whether any micronutrient deficiencies exist and recommends appropriate application rates. 4. Organic Amendments: Adding organic matter to the soil improves its fertility, structure, and water-holding capacity. The application rate for organic amendments, such as well-rotted farmyard manure or compost, can vary depending on their nutrient content. As a general guideline, 10-20 tons per hectare of organic matter may be applied before or during sugarcane planting. 5. Split Application: It's common practice to divide the total enricher application into several doses during different growth stages of sugarcane. For example, applying a portion of the recommended fertilizers during planting or before the onset of the rainy season, and then dividing the remaining amount into two or three subsequent applications based on the crop's growth stage. 6. Irrigation and Environmental Factors: The rates of enricher application may also be influenced by irrigation practices, rainfall patterns, temperature conditions, and other environmental factors. Adjustments may be necessary to account for variations in soil moisture and nutrient availability. It's important 

Soil pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of the soil. It determines the soil's ability to support plant growth by influencing nutrient availability, microbial activity, and overall soil health. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with values less than 7 considered acidic, values greater than 7 considered alkaline, and a pH of 7 being neutral. For sugarcane cultivation, soil pH is an important factor to consider as it directly affects the crop's growth, nutrient uptake, and overall productivity. Sugarcane plants generally prefer slightly acidic to neutral soils with pH levels ranging from 5.5 to 7.5. However, certain sugarcane varieties may tolerate slightly higher or lower pH levels. Highly acidic soils (pH below 5.5) can inhibit root development, nutrient availability, and microbial activity, leading to stunted growth and reduced yields. In such cases, lime application is recommended to raise the pH and neutralize the acidity. Alkaline soils (pH above 7.5) can cause nutrient imbalances, hinder nutrient absorption, and result in poor plant growth and cane quality. Acidifying amendments like elemental sulfur or organic materials can be used to lower the pH and make the soil more suitable for sugarcane cultivation. It is crucial to periodically test the soil pH to ensure it remains within the optimal range for sugarcane. Soil testing laboratories provide accurate pH measurements based on the H2O (water) extraction method. Monitoring and managing soil pH allows farmers to make informed decisions regarding lime or amendment applications to maintain desired pH levels for optimal sugarcane growth and productivity. 

Soil pH refers to the measurement of how acidic or alkaline the soil is. It is important to know the pH level of the soil as it affects the availability of nutrients to plants and the activity of soil microorganisms. pH is measured on a scale of 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Values below 7 indicate acidity, while values above 7 indicate alkalinity. The KCl measurement in soil pH refers to the method of using potassium chloride (KCl) solution to extract the soil sample for pH testing. KCl is commonly used because it does not react with soil components and provides a more accurate pH measurement. Why is it important? 1. Nutrient Availability: Soil pH affects the availability of essential nutrients to plants. Each nutrient has an optimum pH range at which it is most easily absorbed by plant roots. For example, at higher pH levels, some essential nutrients like iron and manganese become less available to plants, leading to deficiency symptoms. 2. Microbial Activity: Soil pH influences the activities of soil microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and other decomposers. These microorganisms play a crucial role in nutrient cycling and organic matter decomposition. Different microorganisms thrive in different pH ranges, thereby influencing overall soil fertility. 3. Soil Structure: pH also affects soil structure and nutrient retention. Soils with extreme pH levels (very acidic or highly alkaline) tend to have poor aggregation and compacted texture, causing issues with water infiltration and root penetration. How to measure soil pH? 1. Collect a representative soil sample from your field or garden using a soil probe or shovel. Make sure to collect soil from different locations within the area you want to test. 2. Remove any debris like roots or stones and break up any clumps of soil. 3. Take a small portion of soil and add it to a clean container. Avoid using metal containers as they can react with the soil and impact the pH reading. 4. Add water to the container and mix it well to form a slurry. The ratio of soil to water should be around 1:1. 5. Let the soil-water mixture settle for a few hours to allow any suspended particles to settle at the bottom. 6. Using a pH meter or a pH testing kit, measure the pH of the soil extract. The pH meter provides a more accurate measurement, while pH testing kits provide a color-based indication. 7. Record the pH reading in KCl measurement, which measures the pH 

The organic nitrogen content in soil refers to the amount of nitrogen present in organic matter, such as decaying plant and animal residues, compost, and other organic substances. It is a crucial aspect of soil health as nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plant growth and plays a significant role in maintaining soil fertility. Here are some key points about organic nitrogen content in soil: 1. Importance of organic nitrogen: Nitrogen is a vital element required for plant growth and development. Organic nitrogen sources provide a slow-release form of nitrogen that is more sustainable and environmentally friendly compared to synthetic fertilizers. It helps in improving soil fertility, increasing crop yields, and promoting overall soil health. 2. Sources of organic nitrogen: Organic nitrogen is primarily derived from organic matter decomposition. When plant residues, such as leaves, stems, and roots, break down, they release nitrogen into the soil. Animal manure, poultry litter, compost, and green manure cover crops are also excellent sources of organic nitrogen. 3. Mineralization: Organic nitrogen is not directly available to plants. It needs to undergo mineralization, a process by which microorganisms convert organic nitrogen compounds into inorganic forms, such as ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-), which plants can use. This conversion is driven by soil microbial activity and is influenced by factors like temperature, moisture, and pH. 4. Nutrient cycling: Organic nitrogen is a component of the larger nutrient cycling process in soils. As plants take up nitrogen from the soil, it enters the food chain, reaching animals and eventually returning to the soil through excreta and decomposing organic matter. This cyclic process helps maintain the organic nitrogen content in the soil over time. 5. Organic nitrogen testing: Soil testing can determine the organic nitrogen content in the soil. Various laboratory methods, such as the Walkley-Black procedure or the Kjeldahl method, are used to quantify the organic nitrogen concentration. These tests provide valuable information about soil fertility, nitrogen availability, and can help in making informed decisions about nutrient management. 6.

The OBIA procedure computes multiple ...Most research in the crop-weed competition domain is limited to assessing crop yield losses due to weed pressure and other crop-weed interactions, overlooking the significant uptake of soil-water by weeds that exacerbates global water constraints and threatens productivity and profitability. The objective of this review was to ...Weed-Control Costs . Farmers whotake prevented plant coverage also must remember that weeds will grow, even if the crop doesn't. Mark Loux, Ohio State University Extension weeds specialist, advises farmers to budget for two passes of either mowing, tillage, or herbicide applications.Many plants are low-growing and spreading in habit and may be termed ground-cover, but the prime requisite of a good ground cover plant is to provide a rapid, dense cover, to suppress germination and development of weed seeds and to eliminate the need for weed control measures.Dragon's blood sedum may be the hardiest and most versatile of all weed-suppressing ground covers. A cultivar of the succulent Sedum spurium, dragon's blood ('Schorbuser Blut') is hardy in Zones 3-8. Not only does it grow in full sun as well as partial shade, but it also thrives in poor soil.

1.1. What are service plants and why are they important? Service plants are spontaneous vegetation (weeds) and sown plant species associated with a perennial crop in the rows or inter-rows with a high potential to provide ecosystem functions and services. In the literature,Service plants are spontaneous vegetation (weeds) and sown plant species associated with a perennial crop in the rows or inter-rows with a high potential to provide ecosystem functions and services.Service plants are spontaneous vegetation (weeds) and sown plant species associated with a perennial crop in the rows or inter-rows with a high potential to provide ecosystem functions and services. In literature, these plants are often named âvegetation coverâ (Hall et al., 2020; Winter et al., 2018) but without linking their activity to ...Row Spacing. Row spacing interacts with plant population and the arrangement of plants within the row. From: The Solar Corridor Crop System, 2019. Related terms: Herbicide; Cultivar; Maize; Weed Management; Water Use Efficiency; Planting Density; Irrigation; Weeds; Weed Control; Plant DensityThe differences in weed coverage between the 68-cm row spacing and 17- and 34-cm row spacings were less pronounced in this environment compared to the Goldsboro 2013 environment . Weed coverage declined with increasing seeding rate in the 17-cm row spacing, but not in the other row spacings .Bilgili et al. (2003) conducted a field research to examine the influence of different row spacing (17.5 cm, 35 cm, 52.5cm, 70 cm) on seed yield and yield component of Brassica rapa L. in Turkey. They found maximum plant height (147.3cm) and number of plants (122 m-2) at narrow row spacing 17.5 cm.A review of row spacing experiments included in this review revealed that narrow row spacings have provided significant reductions in the late-season density of weeds in the majority of soybean experiments but only rarely in corn. This research also indicates that narrow row soybeans are more likely to impact the critical time of weed removal ...row and alleyway weed coverage and densities of broadleaf and grass weeds.

Among the living mulch species, sage and lemongrass guaranteed an almost full soil cover, reducing the need for weed management along the row, as well as increasing the beneficial insects without influencing the young tree ...This paper presents detailed simulation, laboratory and field investigations into the design and performance of a novel mechanical system for inter- and intra-row weed control. The mechanical ...Cover crops or companion crops are increasingly used in cropping systems to favor biological regulations and deliver agroecosystem services such as weed, pest, disease, or erosion control, as well as nitrogen fixation (Quintarelli et al. 2022 ).The newest guidance-equipped inter-row hoeing systems can cover up to 83 % of the field [ 1, 2 ]. Unfortunately, the weeds occurring within the remaining area between (intra-row) and around the crop plants (close-to-crop) have a significant influence on plant development and yield.Although inter-row cultivation is a relatively effective method of weed control, weeds in the intra-row still often require manual labor . Weed control in crop rows is one of the main problems in ecological farming, as it has a significant impact on crop yields [ 25 ].Intra-row weeds are those that grow within the line of row crop plants and are not affected by inter-row cultivation, such as hoeing. Intra-row weeds, if insufficiently controlled, cause major problems for organic growers in row crops, such as vegetables and maize (Zea mays L.). Manual intra-row weeding can be laborious, particularly ...Numerous prototypes exist for inter-row weeding but very limited for intra-row weed eradication. This study developed a tractor drawn integrated inter- and intra-row weeding (IIIRW) system for field crops. Active rotary tines were used for intra-row weeding and passive tines for inter-row weeding.

The simple coverage problem requires that UAVs inspect every portion of the field by visiting (and inspecting) each cell at least once. Ideally, every cell is visited only once by one UAV and the coverage time \(t_c\) is minimised.(3) weed n = f-f min f max-f min s max-s min + s min where f denotes the current weedâs fitness, the best and least fitness of the current population is represented by f max and f min. The maximum and least value of a weed is represented by s max and s min .OE indicates the proportion of frames with an observed weed coverage that was misclassified as being of a different coverage, and CE indicates the proportion of frames classified with levels of weed coverage that really correspond to other levels of coverage.Weed coverage (%) for the different methods of weed control in 2017 to 2019. (a-c): Weed assessment 2 (after the pre-emergence bean herbicide application). (d-f): Weed assessment 3 (14 days after ...Similarly, total weed coverage and perennial coverage in reduced tillage treatments were two to three times greater compared with conventional treatments (Sans et al., 2011). Weed biomass in barley showed also higher rates in the conservation compared to the conventional tillage treatment ( Vakali et al., 2011 ).Data were estimated via human vision, and total weed coverage, i.e., the percentage of a plotâs area covered by weeds when projecting the weed plants vertically to ground level, was assigned to each plot. Weed coverage values could be in the range of 0â100%. Plots were located semi-randomly in each field to constitute a range in ...The sampling points are continuous and the interpolation methods are used at the minimum levels. The experiment result shows that this weed mapping method can map weed under limited conditions.Shallow conservation tillage also led to an average increase of weed coverage and weed species number in regard to ST and CTD. Weed coverage was 60% higher, and the weed species number was 66% higher, with CTS compared to ST, which was not significantly different from CTD. All investigated parameters of maize weediness were, on ...In each cell, the percentage of weed coverage was calculated, and Moran's I, a common spatial autocorrelation test (Moran 1950; KrÃ¤hmer et al. 2020), was used to describe the spatial pattern of the grid cells comprised of weeds (weed coverage > 0%) using the âSpatial Autocorrelation Global Moranâs Iâ in ArcMap 10.5.This study aims to account for these three feasibility factors using three additional metrics. This paper introduces a new metric weed coverage rate (WCR), which identifies the proportion of weeds in the dataset that fall within the target area of a sprayer given a set of detections.

Row cover ranges in thicknesses. A lighter weight fabric, might be labeled as .45 or .5 oz/sq. yd., whereas a heavier weight fabric might be labeled as somewhere between 1.5 and 2.2 oz/sq. yd. Row cover can be cut to size using sharp scissors, which is helpful because it typically comes in large rolls of varying widths and lengths.Row cover, or garden row fabric, is a thin, breathable fabric with many versatile uses in the garden. It allows sunlight and water in while keeping bugs and extreme weather out. The lightweight material is typically spun-bonded from polyester or polypropylene and is designed to protect your crops from environmental stressors.Also known as Garden Fabrics, the floating row cover is mostly a thin plastic or material that is either transparent or semi-transparent and is used to shield plants from harsh weather conditions such as frost and intense sunlight. It also acts as a protective cover for the plants against harmful insects.Roots were studied in the setting of three inter-row conditions: sugarcane with full chemical weed control, sugarcane-jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) intercropping, and sugarcane with spontaneous weeds in the inter-row. Root mappings were conducted at 3.5, 6, 8, and 11 months after sugarcane planting in two vertical trenches per age ...We finally got all our plants in the ground. We covered the garden area with weed barrier or row cover. And planted our tomatoes, peppers, and artichokes. The weed fabric should prevent...1. Cross-Pollination If you want to save your seeds and would like to avoid raising hybrids, itâs important to prevent cross-pollination. One way of doing this is to cover the plants with row covers. They will stop the wind from pollinating the plants and also deter bees in some cases. 2. Pest ProtectionYour guide to growing garlic in winter for a delicious season-long harvest. Step 3: Secure your row cover to the ground with landscaping pins, either just on the long sides or on all four sides. Step 4: Remove the row covers from time to time to water and weed your garden.Use row covers to warm garden soil and protect tender seedlings or vegetable plants from frost. Row covers are made from materials that are either waterproof or allow moisture to pass through them. Row covers may be either tunnels or caps like mini-greenhouses or floating blankets of breathable fabric held by supports over the plants. Install ...As much as we love row covers, so do the weeds. One disadvantage to using row covers in the garden is weed growth. Weeds also love the slight temperature increase from the row covers and grow at an accelerated rate. We think the advantages outweigh this disadvantage, so go cover your garden!The easiest way to manage weeds is to spray them with herbicide. When applied to a small weed, it shrivels up and dies, decomposes, and isnât a big concern. However, when a bed is full of a groundcover plant herbicide injury could occur. There are a few exceptions of specialty herbicides and these cover only a minimal amount of weed varieties.

Fine root distribution, root length densities, and a soil colonization index were estimated from the root intersects, in relation to plant root co-occurrence. We found that both legumes and weeds in the inter-row decreased the total sugarcane fine root length by 17 to 30% compared to situation of chemical weed control from 6 months ...â¢ The great diversity of weeds (weeds with short or long cycle; annual, biennial and perennial, dicotyledonous or mon-ocotyledonous; erect or creeping) hampers their management. They can be controlled simply by applying a broad-leaf herbicide in the intended plant cover area, which eliminates the other weeds.Weed cover on undisturbed inter-rows was generally lower or equivalent to weed cover on rows. Weed cover on inter-rows compacted by tractor wheels was always equivalent or higher than weed cover on rows. Using inter-rows to detect weeds could underestimate weed pressure in corn and soybean in QuÃ©bec, unless the inter-rows trampled ...Tables 2, 3 and 4 show the effect of inter row spacing and weed control on weed cover score, weed density and weed dry matter production. Inter-row spacing did not have any significant effect (pâ¥0.05) on these parameters in the early seasons of 2009 and 2010.Vegetation sensors could be used in the inter-rows to trigger herbicide spraying on both rows and inter-rows if weed cover on and between the crop rows is uniform. To verify this hypothesis, weed cover on and between corn rows was evaluated using photographs acquired in corn fields at the 3 to 5 leaf stage. A one hectare plot was sampled in ...Inter- row hoeing usually provides a complete weed control in the inter-row zone unless rainy weather prevail for long periods. The operation of inter-row hoes is less requiring than weed harrows where the operator needs to learn the timing and settings that provide effective weed control while preserving the crop.Review and discussion of inter-row and intra-row mechanical weeding, two different mechanical weed control techniques. In particular, reviews and comparisons of the most popular manual...A green cover should be ensured in the inter-row alleyway to prevent soil erosion and allow the transit of machineries, whereas weed management along the row is mandatory to reduce the competition for water and nutrients. The inter-row green cover is generally managed with 3-4 mowing sessions per year, but alternative solutions can promote a ...We tested this framework in a Mediterranean vineyard where we characterized, during 2 years, the responses of different components of weed communities (taxonomic and functional composition) in three inter-row management practices (tillage, cover crops and mowing spontaneous vegetation) and their effects on several grapevine processes ...Download scientific diagram | Effect of Inter-row Spacing and Weed Management on Weed Cover Score, Weed Density and Weed Dry Matter Production in the Early Season of 2009. from publication ...

During the grapevine dormancy period, 64.4 % of the winegrowers having a service plant (therefore excluding bare soil strategies) used a full surface coverage strategy. The others either chose an inter-row coverage or a row coverage and, a minority of 0.6 %, used a permanent plastic mulch on the row. After grapevine budburst, the ...Given the diversity of the strategies of service plant management, we proposed a typology analyzing their spatial and temporal dimensions.

This row is being covered to help maintain adequate soil temperatures for seed germination in direct-sown crops. The covers are supported by fiberglass rods, wires, PVC hoops, plastic-coated steel hoops, or anything strong and bendable.So, service plants or cover crops? The answer is both â itâs simply a matter of scale. A cover crop is a planted crop grown during intercropping periods, typically not harvested that aims to cover the soil for various purposes. It is one of the applications made possible by service crops. However, service crops are not limited to ...Here, we present an overview of the current uses of intercropped service plants in temperate cropping systems, with the main services they provide and their management.

Cover crops (CC) are biological tools with a great potential for weed control, but the suppression level depends on the CC species and management. A 2-year study was performed in the eighth year of a long-term experiment located in Central Spain to study the effect of replacing winter fallow by barley (.Weed coverage was reduced by up to 75% using this most effective herbicide strategy and by up to 61% through mechanical weed control, compared to the control. The additional effects of post-emergence treatment on the pre-emergence herbicide control resulted in a 16.5% weed coverage decline.The different sowing methods had no effect on weed coverage or weed contamination in the cleaned seed. Increasing sowing rate usually had a negative influence on seed yield, while weed coverage/contamination was not significantly affected.Coverage was too low at spray volumes of 100 to 200 L ha â1, for adequate contact activity of both PA-MPEG and PA. Weed control was significantly increased when PA-MPEG application was made at lower boom height with reduced distance to weed canopy, or under warm and dry climate conditions.

The experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replications. Table 2.Ongoing research continues to identify and test ânewâ plant species for use as weed-suppressive cover plants (e.g., Brust et al., 2014), and nascent breeding efforts could further improve these and existing cover plant species in the area of weed management (Foley, 1999; Wayman et al., 2017).In 2020, the University of Vermont Extension Northwest Crops and Soils Program investigated the impact of spring cover crop termination methods on a subsequent soybean cropâs yield and quality at Borderview Research Farm in Alburgh, VT.Ground cover was similar between the tillage, no-till (21% cover), early termination, plant termination (21% cover), and forage harvest treatments. At Lancaster, weed ground cover for the late termination (8% cover) soil management treatment was lower than the no-till (22% cover) treatment, while ground cover was similar between the ...Introduction Cover crops are important tools employed in organic agriculture to improve soil quality and fertility ( 1 â 4 ). Living cover crops can prevent soil erosion during fallow periods and compete directly with weeds for sunlight and nutrients ( 5, 6 ).In the studied systems, the 2018 mid-season cover crops fostered a soil bacterial community distinct from early season cover crops and fallow, reinforcing the selectivity of some plant species. However, the difference in planting dates cannot be separated from the cover crop treatments, limiting the interpretation of these results.Over the past six years at the Cornell Organic Cropping Systems Trial, we have planted several species of cover crops at many times. In this article I will summarize how they have performed. First, a little background. We have grain and vegetable field experiments.Only âtrad cover modelsâ were utilised to test the main effects of T. fluminensis invasion on native plant growth forms as we were more interested in identifying patterns along the gradient of ...In natural ecosystems, positive effects of plant diversity on ecosystem functioning have been widely observed, yet whether this is true in cropping systems remains unclear.

Here we assessed the ...Almost half of the arable land (46 %) was covered by normal winter crops. Cover or intermediate crops, plant residues and multi-annual plants occupy shares of 8 %, 7 % and 8 % respectively in arable land. The soil cover on arable land during winter varies among countries.The Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) was selected to develop two additional approaches. One is based on a regression biomass prediction model (R 2 of 0.80 and 0.66 for FM and DM, respectively) and leads to an accurate estimation at levels of FM lower than 3 kg/m 2 (0.6 kg DM/m 2). The other approach is based on a ...In corn and soybean, weed ground cover was lower for soil management with cereal rye cover crop terminated two weeks after cash crop planting (â¤ 7% weed cover) compared to all other soil management practices (â¥ 23% weed cover) when a preemergence herbicide was not used.Here we present a series of maps detailing the evolution of European forest cover during last 12000 years.

Cover crops (plants grown in an agricultural rotation between cash crops) can significantly improve soil quality via sequestering carbon, retaining nutrients, decreasing soil erosion...However, plants under prolonged snow cover seemed to compensate for the shorter growing period, likely increasing carbon allocation to growth. In fact, these latter showed larger needles and low starch content at the beginning of the growing season. Variability between treatments slightly decreased over time, suggesting a progressive ...Groundcover or ground cover is any plant that grows over an area of ground. Groundcover provides protection of the topsoil from erosion and drought. In an ecosystem, the ground cover forms the layer of vegetation below the shrub layer known as the herbaceous layer. The most widespread ground covers are grasses of various types.If we exclude EUP, all treatments had a relatively high plant cover, at both the beginning (from 59.2% to 87.5% plant cover) and the end of the 2015 season (from 55.3% to 91.1% plant cover) (Table 2). Plant cover was low in the early season for EUP (17.6%) but reached 51.7% at the end of the growing season.We review current guidelines and precedents on the issue of coverage, as well as their underlying considerations, for four major study designs, which include de novo genome sequencing, genome ...Compared to plant-free controls, cover cropping had a significant impact on soil nitrogen levels in these short-term, springtime trials, but we found very few overall differences between plots that used different functional groups of cover crops (brassicas vs. grasses vs. legumes). By far, the most important differences appeared to ...Without annual winter cover crops to intercept plant available N, losses of N in Systems 1 and 2 were undoubtedly higher than in Systems 3, 4 and 5 that were cover cropped annually.

Related terms: Soil Erosion; Soil ...The data collected consisted of plant height (PH), number of tillers, number and length of leaves and fresh yield. The yield and chemical analysis of forage samples were analyzed for dry matter ...We conducted three separate experiments for the validation of canopy height, canopy ground cover, and above-ground biomass using the Phenomobile Lite. Canopy height was validated in Experiment 1 (EXP1), canopy ground cover was validated in Experiment 2 (EXP2) and above-ground biomass was validated in Experiment 3 (EXP3).We used an experimental precipitation gradient combined with mimicked acute hay harvest (clipping once a year) to examine (1) whether hay harvest influences precipitation effects on plant...Figure 26 shows that erosion is dependent not only on plant cover but also on plant height above the ground. For example, when plant cover is 100% but is 4 metres high, erosion will be about 75% of that on a bare plot; if the cover is 2 metres high, erosion will be about 50%; and if it is 50 cm high, erosion will still be about 18%. However, if ...The density coefficient is multiplied by a basal K c representing full cover conditions, K cb full, to produce a basal crop coefficient that represents actual conditions of ET and vegetation coverage when the soil surface is dry. K cb full is estimated primarily as a function of crop height.

Previously reported maize phyllochron values range from 61.7 to 85.1 Â°C d leaf â1 below the turning point and 25.3 to 35.3 Â°C d leaf â1 above the turning point (Muchow and Carberry, 1989; Zhu et al., 2014).Biophysical crop models convert GDD accumulation to leaf numbers by using a constant parameter termed phyllochron (Â°C-day leaf â1) or leaf appearance rate (LAR; leaf o C-day â1 ). However, such important parameter values are rarely estimated for modern maize hybrids.ects of temperature and photoperiod on the daily rate of seedling emergence (1/t50%) and the rate of leaf appearance (leaves d71) were quantiÂ®ed for 12 diverse legume cover crop species. Six tropical or subtropical species were grown in 12 combinations of mean temperature (16.8, 21.8 and 26.88C) and photoperiod (11.5, 12.5, 13.5 and 14.5 h d71).We measured trait values and leaf areas of 17 tropical cover species grown for 1 month in a growth chamber. Strong positive and negative covariations were observed between SM, LMF a and RGR a , revealing a âsyndromeâ of traits and suggesting trade-offs between traits.Two approaches quantifying potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Kennebec) leaf appearance rates were evaluated: a thermal time approach using the phyllochron, and a nonlinear temperature response...Biophysical crop models convert GDD accumulation to leaf numbers by using a constant parameter termed phyllochron (Â°C-day leaf -1) or leaf appearance rate (LAR; leaf o C-day -1 ). However, such important parameter values are rarely estimated for modern maize hybrids.Here, we conducted a series of experiments in the field to quantify and disentangle the effects of sowing date and cultivar on maize leaf collar appearance (LCA). A bilinear model was found to accurately fit maize LCA (R > 0.99); this model revealed a slower rate of LCA for the first leaves compared to the last leaves.Crop growth rate (CGR) and crop nitrogen acquisition rate (CNR) can be used as two indicators of the ability of cover crops to produce these services in agrosystems. We used leaf functional traits to characterise the growth strategies of 36 cover crops as an approach to assess their ability to grow and acquire N rapidly. We measured ...In this paper, leaf surface phenotypes are characterized for 349 leaf samples based on polarized light reflectance measured at Brewsterâs Angle, and microscopic observation.

The microscopic and ...Effects of different covering materials treatments on plant functional traits. The specific leaf area is closely related to the growth rate of plants. It can reflect the balance between the acquisition and utilization of carbon by plants [ 29, 30 ].

The analysis of plant growth fundamentally changes when the focus shifts from individual plants to communities, because land surface area becomes an additional reference metric (Table 2). For example, while individual plants may grow less or slower, growth per unit land surface area may still be higher, so that any quantification of ...For example, choose Delosperma brunnthaleri, a hardy ground cover that grows around 2 inches tall and 2 feet wide with yellow flowers and ideal for zones 4 to 9. Select Delosperma floribundum 'Starburst', a mat-forming cultivar with pink flowers and white centers for zones 6 to 8.However, when left to grow on its own, the perennial is a spreading shrub or ground cover, growing 1Â½ to 2 feet tall and 4 to 5 feet in spread. The plant thrives in zones 7b to 10b and grows in moist, well-draining soil. It prefers bright, indirect light with around four hours of direct sunlight daily.Ground cover was estimated from LiDAR using two methodologies: red reflectance image and canopy height. In contrast to NDVI, LiDAR was not affected by saturation at high ground cover, and the comparison of both LiDAR methodologies showed strong association ( r2 = 0.92 and slope = 1.02) at ground cover above 0.8.The coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) values for measured and estimated plant height across various growth stages were 0.93 and 0.17 m, respectively.1.

Multiplying these numbers will provide an estimated total number of leaves.Leaf, any usually flattened green outgrowth from the stem of a vascular plant. Leaves are the primary sites of photosynthesis and manufacture food for plants. They are an integral part of the stem system and can be modified into a variety of other plant organs.However, larger leaves may be more susceptible to herbivory and have higher within-leaf support costs (Niinemets et al., 2006). A number of leaf venation properties also vary predictably with leaf size (Sack et al., 2012; Baird et al., 2021). For all these reasons, leaf size is a key element of numerous studies on plant functional ecology. Its ...In this study, we focus on the task of leaf counting. The number of leaves a plant has is one of the visual key traits (phenotype) describing its development and growth (Dobrescu et al., 2017). It enables growth rate estimation and is related to the health status of the plant and its yield potential (Telfer et al., 1997; Walter and Schurr, 1999).The arrangement of leaves on a stem is known as phyllotaxy. The number and placement of a plantâs leaves will vary depending on the species, with each species exhibiting a characteristic leaf arrangement. Leaves are classified as either alternate, spiral, opposite, or whorled.Leaves can be found in a variety of shapes and sizes. Most leaves are broad, flat and typically green in color. Some plants, such as conifers, have leaves that are shaped like needles or scales. Leaf shape is adapted to best suit the plant's habitat and maximize photosynthesis.Leaves by number. Fibonacci numbers are notorious for appearing in the most unlikely places, including the architecture of plants. Elsewhere in this issue, Didier Reinhardt and colleagues describe ...

P.O. Box 84 Lincoln University Canterbury, New Zealand. Abstract The base temperature (Tb) and thermal time (Tt) requirements for germination and emergence of temperate herbage species were defined using a linear model of development rate against temperature. A Tb of 4Â°C was found for all species.Instead of accumulating temperatures above 0Â°C, thermal time systems now use a base or threshold temperature, t base, which varies with species and is estimated as the value that provides the most constant value of k.The base temperatures for shoot emergence were positive and higher than for germination. The base temperature for shoot emergence in English acorns was about 3 Â°C higher than for Italian acorns (Table 4). The thermal time required for 50 % emergence was about 27 weeks higher for Italian acorns.Relationship between temperature and duration of one generation of a temperate (Meloidogyne hapla, T b = 8.25Â°C and DD = 554 Â°C days) and tropical (M. javanica, T b = 12.9Â°C and DD = 350...Download scientific diagram | Accumulation of above ground biomass as a function of thermal time from emergence (base temperature = 0Â°C).

The base temperature (T b) and thermal time (Tt) requirements for germination and emergence of temperate herbage species were defined using a linear model of development rate against temperature. A T b of â¤ 4Â°C was found for all species.The major driving force that pushes wheat through its successive developmental stages from emergence through double ridge, to flowering and maturity is temperature. Development can occur over a range of temperatures; below 0Â° C is too cold for most varieties and much above 30Â° C is too hot.All 48 parameterisation data sets that included both sowing date and emergence were used to calculate the median of the temperature sum for this interval, i.e. the value of P9 using a base temperature of 0 Â°C.Thermal time models were successfully developed for 0, 5, 10 and 15Â°C temperature amplitudes, using 28 constant and alternating temperature regimes. These models were then modified by linking seed germination in Petri dishes and seedling emergence in soil.We found an optimal temperature for cercarial emergence of 32.0 Â°C and 33.5 Â°C for Acanthotrema tridactyla and Cyathocotylidae gen. sp., respectively, which are the warmest recorded thermal ...

Flowering time is of importance in plant breeding as it is central for the adaptation of wheat to different climatic regions and consequently also affects yield potential.Though not significantly different to 8 Â°C, a base temperature of 8.6â9.4 Â°C (T b 8.6âT b 9.4) adequately estimated thermal time (TT) durations for the emergence-flowering phase while T b 0 was more satisfactory for estimating grain filling duration.Abstract. We assessed mechanistic temperature influence on flowering by incorporating temperature-responsive flowering mechanisms across developmental age into an existing model. Temperature influences the leaf production rate as well as expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T ( FT ), a photoperiodic flowering regulator that is expressed in ...From an agricultural perspective, increasing ambient temperatures between â¼12Â°C and 27Â°C tend to increase photosynthetic capacity, resulting in an overall increase in energy stores and plant biomass ( Bernacchi et al., 2009; Wigge, 2013 ).The authors started their investigation by taking several spring B. napus cultivars to measure their flowering time under optimal (21Â°C) and high (28Â°C) temperatures. Most of the tested varieties showed delayed flowering at high temperatures, except for Wesway, which flowered earlier at warmth.The cardinal temperatures describe the response of rate to temperature, where: T b (base temperature) is that temperature at and below which the rate is zero; T o (optimum temperature) is that temperature at which the rate is maximal; and T m, where the rate is again zero.

Instead of accumulating temperatures above 0Â°C, thermal time systems now use a base or threshold temperature, t base, which varies with species and is estimated as the value that provides the most constant value of k. Using this system, heat sum is calculated from daily temperatures above t base , as indicated by the subscript + in equation 2Pour calculer la valeur du nombre de degrÃ©s jour, il faut Ã©tablir une tempÃ©rature de base ( 6 Â°C pour le maÃ¯s ou 0 Â°C pour le blÃ© par exemple), puis noter les tempÃ©ratures maximale et minimale d'une journÃ©e.

Basic engineering theory and empirically determined allometric relationships for the biomass partitioning patterns of extant tree-sized plants show that the mechanical requirements for vertical growth do not impose intrinsic limits on the maximum heights that can be reached by species with woody, self-supporting stems.We hypothesize that flowering phenology correlates with plant height growth pattern and that the pattern is associated with functional traits including maximum plant height ( Hmax ), RGR, stem tissue mass density (SD), hollow ratio (proportion of central hollow of stem cross-sectional area) and leaf mass per area (LMA) in grassland ...We were able to relate r m to maximum plant height for a total of 339 plant species, with a height range of 0.02â110 m. 2.2.3 . Variance in population growth rate (Ï r 2 )Species growth rates, measured as length extension or diameter increment of the most vigorous shoots on each plant, were correlated with a range of traits that included the maximum attainable height of the species, leaf size, LA/XA, xylem-specific conductivity and twig diameter at 40 cm from the tip (Table 1 ).Potential height is an important aspect of the ecology of a plant species 1, 2, 3. Potential or maximum canopy height can range from â¼5 cm to >50 m and this full range can be found at a single site. The benefit of height is pre-emptive access to light: taller plants shade shorter plants but not vice versa.Path analysis on plant height, hydraulic traits, and AI.

The radiation use efficiency (RUE) of crops is a measure of the conversion of intercepted radiation to biomass. It can be calculated as a function of PAR or solar radiation, using shoots or whole crops, and calculated as the ratio or slope of the regression between biomass and intercepted radiation.This chapter reviews the various aspects of radiation use efficiency (RUE). Topics that are covered include theoretical analyses, experimental determination and measures, and sources of variability. Crop growth rate (dm/dt) could be readily estimated from successive harvests through the growing season. The studies that examined ...The analysis of radiation capture and radiation use efficiency in this study indicates that mixture performance was governed by species dominance within the mixture, with the species capturing most of the light determining to a large extent the radiation use efficiency of the mixture as a whole. Results show the importance of ...Radiation use efficiency is a valuable term to relate biomass accumulation to IPAR; however, the methods to estimate RUE require detailed measurements throughout the growing season. This study was designed to evaluate the use of VIs to measure IPAR throughout the growing season.Radiation use efficiency was highest during rapid growth (2.4 g/MJ) and lower during establishment (1.0 g/MJ) and grain filling (1.3 g/MJ). The low RUE during establishment was associated with a large proportion of leaves exposed to high radiation, and the intrinsically lower efficiency of leaves at saturated light regimes. The low ...Radiation use efficiency is a complex trait, dependent upon both genetic and environmental factors. As the interception of light is so intrinsically tied to productivity and yield, RUE is key target for future improvement. Advances in technology combined with an increased number of studies on light capture and productivity of plants ...The concept of radiation use efficiency (RUE) has been widely used in crop growth analysis. Following the principles of Monteith (1977), aboveground total dry weight (TDW) is expressed as TDW = RAD â FRI â RUE, where RAD is the incident radiation and FRI is the fraction of radiation intercepted by the crop. N is a key nutrient limiting crop growth (Sinclair and Horie, 1989). Hence, the ...Radiation Use Efficiency (RUE) defines the productivity with which absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) is converted to plant biomass. Readily used in crop growth models to predict dry matter accumulation, RUE is commonly determined by elaborate static sensor measurements in the field.A simple theoretical derivation of RUE was examined and results indicate that plants grown in glasshouses or in other locations with large fractions of diffuse radiation are likely to have greater radiation-use efficiency than observed under primarily direct radiation.Wheat yields are stagnating or declining in many regions, requiring efforts to improve the light conversion efficiency, known as radiation use efficiency (RUE).

If we compare adult men born in 1996 versus those born a century earlier â men who had reached the age of 18 in 2014 versus 1914 â we see that the global mean height for men increased from 162 to 171 centimeters (cm). We see this in the chart. For women, this increased from 151 cm to 159 cm.The median (50th percentile) growth curves for males and females 0â20 years in the United States The study of height is known as auxology. [11] Growth has long been recognized as a measure of the health of individuals, hence part of the reasoning for the use of growth charts.The pace of growth in height has not been uniform over the past century. The impressive rise in height in Japan stopped in people born after the early 1960s ( Figure 6 ). In South Korea, the flattening began in the cohorts born in the 1980s for men and it may have just begun in women.Growth reference 5-19 years - Height-for-age (5-19 years) When autocomplete results are available use up and down arrows to review and enter to select.Alterations in growth rate. At puberty, a considerable alteration in growth rate occurs. There is a swift increase in body size, a change in shape and composition of the body, and a rapid development of the gonads, or sex glandsâthe reproductive organs and the characters signalling sexual maturity. Some of these changes are common to both ...Summary The main factor that influences a personâs height is their DNA. However, other factors can influence how tall a person grows during development, including hormones, medical conditions,...The following are some average ranges of weight and height, based on growth charts developed by the CDC: Although a child may be growing, his or her growth pattern may deviate from the norm. Ultimately, the child should grow to normal height by adulthood.The changes in height of the developing child can be thought of in two different ways: the height attained at successive ages and the increments in height from one age to the next, expressed as rate of growth per year. If growth is thought of as a form of motion, the height attained at successive ages can be considered the distance travelled ...A normal growth rate is when height consistently plots on the same percentile on the growth chart, a rate of at least 2 inches per year during childhood. An abnormal slowing in height growthâdropping down percentilesâmay trigger a full growth evaluation.General characteristics of height growth patterns in puberty between boys and girls. A total of 13,143 students were included in the cohort study, including 7,729 boys (58.8%) and 5,414 girls (41.2%), 7,729 urban (68.8%) and 5,414 rural children (41.2%). The average follow-up duration was 9.0 Â± 1.0 years.

The leaf age index at the turning point varied between sowing dates and cultivars. In FK139, JNK728, and ZD958, the leaf age index at the turning point varied from a minimum of 52.84, 55.20, and 51.5, respectively, to a maximum of 68.50, 68.40, and 67.40, respectively ( Fig. 4 ).The relationship between collared leaf number and growing degree days (GDD) is crucial for predicting maize phenology. Biophysical crop models convert GDD accumulation to leaf numbers by using a constant parameter termed phyllochron (Â°C-day leafâ1) or leaf appearance rate (LAR; leaf oC-dayâ1). However, such important parameter values are ...Plant development is controlled by the leaf appearance rate (LAR) and our understanding of how LAR responds to environmental factors is still limited. Here, we tested the hypothesis that carbon availability may account for the effects of irradiance, photoperiod, atmospheric CO 2 concentration, and ontogeny on LAR.Results indicated that new 111-day hybrids produce leaves faster than old hybrids throughout the vegetative phase (7.4% and 3.1% faster before and after the ninth leaf stage, respectively), whereas new 103-day hybrids produce leaves faster only after the ninth leaf stage (9.4%).At 13/8Â°C, a large proportion of the plants died due to prolonged exposure to cold stress. Both high temperatures and high PPFDs increased leaf-appearance rate. Maximum leaf width was highest at intermediate temperatures and high PPFDs, and was strongly related to specific-leaf weight (R adj2 = 0.88).From the emergence to the V10 stage, leaf collar emergence occurs at â¼29.5 Â°C d per leaf for upper leaves (the 13 th and higher), and LCA is â¼10 Â°C d/leaf (Wuethrich, 1997). The leaf-appearance rates are 61.7 Â°C d per leaf for the first through 12 th leaves and 35.3 Â°Cd per leaf for the 13 th andThe relationship between collared leaf number and growing degree days (GDD) is crucial for predicting maize phenology. Biophysical crop models convert GDD accumulation to leaf numbers by using a constant parameter termed phyllochron (Â°C-day leaf -1 ) or leaf appearance rate (LAR; leaf o C-day -1 ).... Although direct measurements are not available for all optimized parameters, a recent 462 study by [50], explored the variability of leaf appearance rate across 98 sites for maize in 463 the...Here, we conducted a series of experiments in the field to quantify and disentangle the effects of sowing date and cultivar on maize leaf collar appearance (LCA). A bilinear model was found to accurately fit maize LCA (R > 0.99); this model revealed a slower rate of LCA for the first leaves compared to the last leaves.The most frequently used hypothesis-testing model is the which assumes a linear leaf appearance process in thermal time, or equivalently a constant rate of leaf appearance, inferred by a linear regression of the times of measurement (in ATT) on the observed number of leaves, for each plant separately [ ].

Across the 49 plots nested into 17 sites, measured aNPP ranged from 99 g dry mass m â2 year â1 in montane heath to a maximum of 1481 g dry mass m â2 year â1 in intensively managed lowland improved grassland (Fig. 2). Overall, 91 % of the variation in aNPP occurred between sites.We predicted that drought stress, especially at low irrigation frequency, results in a lower aboveground dry mass. Furthermore, we hypothesised that WUE apl increases under drought, most...Measured aboveground dry mass for individual treatments and growth periods and corresponding logistic functions (see Eq. 1). Aboveground biomass on 15 May 1990 (DM0) was not measured, but...Above-ground, below-ground, and total biomass (dry mass) were estimated to be 222.2 Â± 21.1 (CI 95%), 30.7 Â± 2.0, and 252.6 Â± 20.6 Mg ha â1, respectively. The contributions of small trees (5 < D < 10 cm) were 5.7%, 10.9%, and 6.3% to above-ground, below-ground, and total biomass, respectively.Straw mulching with no-tillage showed greater aboveground plant dry mass and shoot N%, leading to increased plant N nutrition, tillering capability, and grain yield.

According toGLOBALâSCALE CLIMATIC CONTROLS OF LEAF DRY MASS PER AREA, DENSITY, AND THICKNESS IN TREES AND SHRUBS - Niinemets - 2001 - Ecology - Wiley Online Library.Here, the authors show that leaf water affects other leaf traits and is a better predictor of whole-leaf photosynthesis and leaf area than leaf nitrogen or phosphorus content.1. Introduction. Leaf dry matter content, also known as the leaf mass per area (LMA), is an indicator of vegetation growing condition. It is defined as the ratio of leaf dry mass to leaf area (unit, g / c m 2), and is widely used a key parameter for studies of terrestrial ecosystem monitoring (Schimel et al., 2015), species identification (Poorter et al., 2009), and fire risk management ...MEASUREMENT OF ABOVE-GROUND NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION Above-ground NPP (g dry mass m 2 year 1) was measured using a variety of methods according to the plant functional types pre-sent. These types comprised C3 graminoids (Poaceae, Junaceaa, Cyperaceae), broad-leaved and needle-leaved trees, dwarf shrubs, forbs and bryophytes (Table 1). All plots ...Many studies have related LMA to gross leaf structure, i.e. to leaf area (LA) and mass (LM), given that LMA = LM/LA, or to leaf thickness (LT) and dry mass density (LD, i.e. dry mass per hydrated volume), given that LMA = LT 9 LD (Witkowski & Lamont 1991; Shipley 1995; Niinemets 1999; Poorter et al. 2009).

The novel method of Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) allows non-invasive soil moisture measurements at a hectometer scaled footprint.

We test the performance of two leaf traits â leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA) â as predictors of above-ground NPP (aNPP) across a realistically wide productivity gradient using comprehensive measurements of aNPP comprising the full range of plant functional types that dominate temperate ecosystems.An essential variable in the context of terrestrial carbon fluxes is aboveground biomass (AGB) density, usually defined as the aboveground standing dry mass of live or dead matter, and typically expressed as mass per unit area (e.g. Mg ha â1) for mapped products (Duncanson et al., 2021).Above ground biomass (AGB) is defined as âthe aboveground standing dry mass of live or dead matter from tree or shrub (woody) life forms, expressed as a mass per unit areaâ , typically Mg ha â1. Urban trees can account for up to 97% of urban AGB . AGB can only be directly measured with destructive harvesting, an expensive and ...Swamy, Dutt, Murthy, Mishra, & Bargali (2010) reported that the AGB in tropical evergreen forest of the Western Ghats ranged between 416 and 552.9 t ha â1 that is slightly on higher range compared to the present study.In absolute terms, trees 100 cm in trunk diameter typically add from 10 kg to 200 kg of aboveground dry mass each year (depending on species), averaging 103 kg per year.

Finally, we provide a comparative assessment of the approaches used to determine RUE.

We found that leaf dry matter content (LDMC) as opposed to specific leaf area (SLA) was the superior predictor of aNPP (R 2 = 0Â·55). Directly measured in situ trait values for the dominant species improved estimation of aNPP significantly.Leaf mass per area (LMA) is a morphological trait widely used as a good indicator of plant functioning (i.e. photosynthetic and respiratory rates, chemical composition, resistance to herbivory, etc.). The LMA can be broken down into the leaf density (LD) and leaf volume to area ratio (LVA or thickness), which in turn are determined ...Leaf mass per area (LMA) (unit: g m â2) Leaf dry mass per unit of lamina surface area (TOP: leaf mass per area, the ratio of the dry mass of a leaf to its area).Abstract. Leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA) is a product of leaf thickness ( T) and of density ( D ). Greater T is associated with greater foliar photosynthetic rates per unit area because of accumulation of photosynthetic compounds; greater D results in decreased foliage photosynthetic potentials per unit dry mass because of lower ...In this study, we used dry mass-based LWC (i.e. the ratio of leaf water mass to leaf dry mass, g g â1), which was calculated from the fresh mass-based leaf water content or LDMC reported in the ...Relationship between (a) leaf volume per area (LVA) with leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA) and (b) leaf density (LD) with LMA for a number of across-species comparisons. Each functional group from each study is represented by a regression line (following type II regression of Warton et al ., 2006 ).Abstract. Leaf dry mass per unit leaf area (LMA) is a central trait in ecology, but its anatomical and compositional basis has been unclear. An explicit mathematical and physical framework for quantifying the cell and tissue determinants of LMA will enable tests of their influence on species, communities and ecosystems.pin 1997; Suding et al. 2008; Reich 2014). We test the per-formance of two leaf traits â leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and speciï¬c leaf area (SLA) â as predictors of above-ground NPP (aNPP) across a realistically wide pro-ductivity gradient using comprehensive measurements of aNPP comprising the full range of plant functional typesLeaf dry mass per area (LMA) is a leaf morphological trait that has often been used as an indicator of sclerophylly (Gratani and Varone, 2006) and a recent review by Flexas et al. examined the relationship between LMA and g m, summarizing data from 17 studies.We used the relationship between petiole width and leaf mass to estimate leaf dry mass per area (LMA), a leaf functional trait negatively correlated with rate of return-on-investment. We found no evidence for a shift in this leaf-economic trait across the KPB: LMA remained consistent in both its median and overall distribution from ...

The most utilized cover crops in both types of experiments were grasses, representing 43% of researcher experiments and 65% of on-farm experiments. On-farm experiments were more likely to include mixtures (33%) compared to researcher experiments (21%).In the 2019â2020 survey, non-adopters of cover crops reported the following land tenure: 39% owned all the land they farmed, 10.4% owned 76â99, 7.8% owned 51â75, 7.8% owned 26â50, 19.5% owned 1â25, and 15.6% owned none of the land they farmed.On U.S. cropland, the use of cover crops increased by 50 percent between 2012 and 2017. During this same period, Federal and State conservation programs increased efforts to promote cover crops through financial and technical assistance. When farmers introduce cover cropsAlmost half of the arable land (46 %) was covered by normal winter crops. Cover or intermediate crops, plant residues and multi-annual plants occupy shares of 8 %, 7 % and 8 % respectively in arable land.

Perhaps the name âsoapwortâ ( Saponaria officinalis) is not the best name for this gorgeous ground cover plant. From May to September, this perennial blooms with delicate pink and white flower clusters.Ground cover plants are often chosen for aesthetic considerations, such as to introduce new colors or textures into a landscape. Or they can be chosen for practical purposes to cover ground where turf grass does not thrive or is not practical. For example, areas of a yard that are deeply shaded might be a good spot for an alternative ...Best ground cover plants: cover bare soil and save on weeding time with these top picks Include our pick of the best ground cover plants in your garden and you'll add interest to tricky areas of the garden with dense planting that looks good and is easy to care forIn landscaping, ground cover plants usually refers to low-lying plants with a creeping or spreading habit, often evergreen and with twiggy dense growth. But the truth is, any plant thatâs no more than three feet at maturity can be regarded as ground cover, especially when planted as a group.Characterized, in part, by how wide-ranging they are, groundcovers can be evergreen or deciduous, low- or tall-growing, clump-forming, trailing, or weeping. But they also share common traits. All groundcovers spread, colonizing areas often relegated to mulch or where turfgrass fears to take hold.

The highest cane yield was recorded in the unsprayed 16-month harvest age treatment, while the highest sucrose yield was recorded in the M + FF ripener combination 12-month harvest age treatment in all the studies.

The maximum value of cane yield ton ha-1 month-1 was recorded at the harvesting age of 16 months for both sugarcane varieties. However, the minimum value was found at the harvesting age of 13 months for both ...To determine the profit from harvesting a farm paddock on a particular date, expected cane yield and CCS responses to harvest date were estimated using historical block productivity data for 1992â1998. These data are held for every farm paddock in a mill region.The DSSAT/CANEGRO model was calibrated using published yield parameters from a selection of five Brazilian sugarcane cultivars, while sugarcane yield data (tons of stems per hectare) from commercial land were used as benchmark data. Other modeling inputs were derived from the primary regional cultivar.Using the suggested method, farmers are likely to be advised to harvest their cane slightly either before or after the yield reaches its maximum level. Hence, data regarding declination rate of cane growth are needed to widen search space for mathematical programming.The zone-level yield estimated from plot-level model seems to overestimate than the realized productivity which could be due to some loss factors of crushable biomass in the process of maturity to harvest to transport and delivery at processing unit.

Agronomic practices to apply existing mineral fertilisers, primarily containing N, P and K, at the right time, the right place, in the right amount, and of the right composition can improve the use efficiency of fertilisers.In order to increase production, more chemical fertilizers are applied to soil, but due to inappropriate application of mineral nutrients, soil degradation, including acidification, secondary salinization, nutrient imbalance, and an abnormal accumulation of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), is common in soils (Cai 2019 ), with sec...Metrics Abstract Nitrogen is the main limiting nutrient after carbon, hydrogen and oxygen for photosynthetic process, phyto-hormonal, proteomic changes and growth-development of plants to complete its lifecycle. Excessive and inefficient use of N fertilizer results in enhanced crop production costs and atmospheric pollution.Fertilizers have played an essential role in feeding a growing global population. Itâs estimated that just under half of the people alive today are dependent on synthetic fertilizers. They can bring environmental benefits too: fertilizers can increase crop yields.The advantages of nitrogen fertilizers from the SRF and CRF groups derive from the following features: (i) they ensure a good supply of nitrogen to plants, especially in critical phases; (ii) they reduce the number of application rates; (iii) they reduce the nitrate content in plants; (iv) they limit nitrogen losses and reduce its ...Soil application of fertilizers to calcareous soils is often ineffective, because of their poor physicochemical properties that restrict the availability of nutritional elements to plants. Inefficient soil fertilization leads to nutritional deficiencies in plants, which decrease the yield.The use of combined fertilisation reduced the amount of mineral fertiliser applied between 33 and 67% and the total fertiliser units between 7 and 40%, while maintaining similar yields to the reference mineral fertilisation (180 NFUs). These results could be related to a higher nitrogen agronomic efficiency in the combined ...The results of this research indicate that the application of MSW compost to tomato plants can serve as a N source in Mediterranean conditions, especially when MSW compost is combined with mineral ...We examine numerous cases by varying the quantity of fertiliser applied to the soil and the fertiliser application times. The numerical experiments suggest that, under uniform rainfall rates, the ...Nutrient use efficiency of plants lies around 30â35%, 18â20%, and 35â40% for N, P, and K, respectively, with the conventional fertilizers. The use of biofertilizers in combination or in place of chemical fertilizers could not make much difference.

The EU depends on imports for 30%, 68% and 85% of its consumption of inorganic nitrogen, phosphates and potash nutrients respectively. Furthermore, at the peaks of gas prices during the summer in 2022, gas had come to account for up to 90% of the variable production cost of nitrogen fertilisers.While an increase in nitrogen use efficiency with less fertiliser input leads to an enhanced nitrogen balance (less nitrogen surplus), the replacement of mineral fertilisers by organic fertilisers, which can be less precisely applied and include other substances, may lead to higher nitrogen emissions from the fertiliser application ...The graph shows mineral fertiliser consumption, separately for nitrogen and phosphorus Estimated mineral fertiliser consumption by agriculture in the EU-27, 2008-2018 â European Environment AgencyNitrogen-based fertilisers accounted for the vast majority (77.4 %) of the nutrients consumed, with an estimated consumption of 59 kg per hectare across the EU, ranging from 19 kg per hectare in Portugal to 125 kg per hectare in the Netherlands.In 1965, the consumption of nitrogen fertilizers stood at some 46.3 million metric tons. By 2021, this amount had increased to 195.38 million tons. In that latter year, nitrogen fertilizers ...Mineral fertilizer products The most frequently used straight nitrogen fertilizers are ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulphate, urea and anhydrous ammonia.

However, over the medium-term, the average for â2020â remained slightly higher than that of â2012â.In 2018, the European agricultural sector consumed 10.2 million tonnes of mineral nitrogen (N) fertiliser and 1.1 million tonnes of mineral phosphorus (P) fertiliser . Reducing these numbers by using technologies that valorise biowaste into bio-based fertiliser (BBF) products can stimulate circularity [ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ].

Lime is widely applied as a soil amendment to reduce the grain cadmium (Cd) content in rice production. However, the. effectiveness of liming on grain Cd reduction is inconsistent and often cannot meet the safety requirements established. for rice production. 1) study the effects of lime application on Cd reduction in rice grains among the ...Surface liming effectively increased water-stable aggregates > 2.0 mm at a depth of up to 0.2 m; however, the association with phosphogypsum was considered a good strategy to improve the macroaggregate stability in subsoil layers (0.20 to 0.40 m). Consequently, both soil amendments applied together increased the mean weight diameter ...Liming rate : The average grain Cd reduction rates under lime dosages of >4500 kg/ha, 1500 to 4500 kg/ha, and <1500 kg/ha were â63%, â40%, and â37%, respectively. This suggests that liming at levels >4500 kg/ha would significantly elevate the grain Cd reduction rate compared to smaller dosages. Lime dosages between 1500 andThis paper describes the most popular natural soil amendments used in agriculture which are here divided into two groups: organic amendments (livestock manures, compost, plant residues, slaughterhouse wastes, sewage sludge, biochar) and mineral amendments (volcanic rocks, gypsum, clay minerals, lime, eggshells).The amount of lime applied was multiplied by the emission factor of lime application (i.e., 0.12 CO2-C t limeâ1 for CaCO3 (IPCC, 2006, IPCC, 2019), as this type of lime was the most common type used in the experiments and in Western Kenya).Liming combined with an optimum quantity of inorganic fertilizer, as a soil amendment in intensive agriculture, is a viable agricultural practice in terms of improving soil nutrient status and productivity, as well as mitigating soil degradation. The chief benefits of this strategy are fundamentally dependent on soil microbial function.The most commonly applied amendments include liming materials, phosphates, minerals, and industrial by-products. Here for simplicity we have initially classified immobilizing agents into either organic or inorganic types and briefly discussed their appropriateness for in situ soil remediation below ( Fig 3 ).Whether applied to tropical soil, lime has been proven to have beneficial effects on the quantity and community composition of virtually all kinds of soil organisms .

Pure water has a pH value of 7.00 at 25 ÂºC; however, samples are especially prone to CO 2 absorption from the atmosphere, which alters the pH from the expected value of 7.00 toward 5.20 due to carbonic acid formation. To minimize this effect, METTLER TOLEDO recommends pH readings in a flow-through cell.It is relatively easy to test the pH level of water and here we will discuss in detail three ways to achieve an accurate pH water test: Using a pH meter; Using pH papers; Using litmus...- the theory and practice of laboratory pH applications 1 pH Booklet Master 25/5/99 10:57 pm Page 1 . This guide to pH measurement has been produced to accompany the latest development in laboratory pH technology. As well as an insight into the theoretical aspects of pH measurement, sections covering applications and electrode troubleshooting have been included to make this a comprehensive ...The pH value is one of the most important and most frequently measured quantities in analytical chemistry. A pH measuring instrument is always needed when the pH reading must be determined accurately. An appropriate pH meter is available in virtually every laboratory.Part A: Using Indicators to Measure pH. In this part of the experiment you will use five indicators to determine the pH of four solutions to within one pH unit. An acid-base indicator is a chemical species that changes color at a specific pH as the pH (acidity) of the solution is varied.The pH of surface water is a common field measurement. This measurement can be made using a Thermo ScientificTM OrionTM ROSSTM UltraTM TriodeTM which will measure both the temperature and pH of the sample with a single probe. The probe provides quick, reproducible results in both fresh and salt water samples.The pH of water is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion activity, which is often assimilated to the hydrogen ion concentration (Eq. [1], Table 1). While the pH of pure water is approximated to be 7.0 at 25 Â°C, the theoretical value is 6.998. Indeed, the dissociation of water and the ionic product for water (Eqs.The reaction of ammonia with water. The whole scale of pH values in aqueous solutions includes both the acidic and alkaline ranges. The values can vary from 0 to 14, where pH values from 0 to 7 are called acidic and pH values from 7 to 14 are termed alkaline. The pH value of 7 is neutral. We measure pH for a lot of different reasons, such as:In general there are three major categories of pH meters. Benchtop pH meters are often used in laboratories and are used to measure samples which are brought to the pH meter for analysis. Portable, or field pH meters, are handheld pH meters that are used to take the pH of a sample in a field or production site. [19]

The numerical difference in the values of pH measured in 1 M KCl and H 2 O (pH KCl â pH H 2O) is referred to as the delta pH. When this difference is negative, the colloid has a net negative charge (cation exchange capacity), and when positive, it has a net positive charge (anion exchange capacity).In this paper, the pH of CO 2-saturated aqueous KCl solutions was measured over wide ranges of temperature and pressure and at salt molalities of 2 molÂ·kg â1 and 4 molÂ·kg â1. The range of conditions investigated covers those relevant to CO 2 storage in deep saline aquifers.pH (KCl) The pH-value in a suspension of sample material and a diluted potassium solution corresponds to the potential acidity. The hydrogen-cations adsorbed to the sample constituents are replaced by potassium cations and are therefore measurable in the suspension. The resulting pH is about 0.3-1.0 units lower compared to the pH in a ...KCl is useful as a beta radiation source for calibration of radiation monitoring equipment, because natural potassium contains 0.0118% of the isotope 40 K. One kilogram of KCl yields 16350 becquerels of radiation , consisting of 89.28% beta and 10.72% gamma , with 1.46083 MeV.A summary of the data used in this study is shown in Table 1 and the frequency distribution plots are shown in Fig. 1. pH values were highest in water, followed by CaCl 2 and lastly in KCl.

Nitrogen Determination in Soil. The Dumas method starts with a combustion furnace (CF) to burn the sample, obtaining elemental compounds. Water is removed by a first physical trap (WT1 - DriStepTM), placed after the combustion, and a second chemical one (WT2).Nitrogen balance is measured by deducting N outputs and changes in soil total N storage from N inputs [1], [2] as follows: Nitrogen balance = N inputs â N outputs â changes in soil total N (1)This technique uses an Elementar vario MAX cube to determine the total N in the soil. It is based on the method originally described by Dumas and later modified by Sweeny (1989). It operates on the principle of quantification of N2 and CO2 after the total combustion of a 250-350 mg* sample at 900Â°C in an oxygen and helium rich atmosphere.The UMS framework can be used to estimate the total nitrogen in soil. However, depending on the types of soil and crops, the model needs to be re-calibrated. More specifically, the actual TN of ...The analysis of total nitrogen in an organic matrix can be carried out using the Dumas method (1831). This involves a total combustion of the matrix under oxygen. The gases produced are reduced by copper and then dried, while the CO2 is trapped. The nitrogen is then quantified using a universal detector.ISO 13878 Soil quality - Determination of total nitrogen content by dry combustion (âelemental analysisâ) EN 13654-2 Soil improvers and growing media - Determination of nitrogen â part 2: Dumas method 2 Scope and working area This standard descibes the determination of total nitrogen (organic and inorganic)In analytical chemistry, the Dumas method is a method of elemental analysis for the quantitative determination of nitrogen in chemical substances based on a method first described by Jean-Baptiste Dumas in 1826.The Dumas method is an elemental analysis for nitrogen determination and it is globally recognised and validated by international organisations such as AOAC, AACC, ISO, DIN, ASBC, AOCS or OIV. In addition to the organic nitrogen content, the combustion method can also be used to analyse the total nitrogen content including inorganic components.Abstract. Dry combustion based on the Dumas (1831) method has become increasingly popular for total nitrogen (N) and isotopeâratio analyses.

This method estimates the relative bioavailability of inorganic ortho-phosphate (PO4-P) in soils with neutral to alkaline pH. It is not appropriate for soils which are mild to strongly acidic (pH <6.5). The method is based on the extraction of phosphate from the soil by 0.5 N sodium bicarbonate solution adjusted to pH 8.5.La mÃ©thode permettant dâextraire de la terre du phosphore dont la composition isotopique est la plus voisine de celle des ions de la solution est jugÃ©e la plus intÃ©ressante.

Soil Olsen P is generally a good indicator to estimate bio-availability of P and environmental risk in alkaline soil. The change in Olsen P is always strongly affected by soil organic carbon (SOC) when different forms of inorganic and ...Summary. Methods for determining soil phosphorus (P), its various forms and availability to plants, have been essential in developing principles and knowledge of the nature and behavior of P in soils. The selection of a suitable method demands a clear statement of objectives that require the soil P measurement.The correlation of Mehlich 3 P and Olsen P methods, excluding soils with pH less than 5 and soils with calcium carbonate levels from 10.3 to 48.3%, resulted in a linear slope of 0.24 and r 2 of 0.82, and thus for this range of soils the Mehlich 3 test provided a more reliable measurement of P compared to the Olsen method. This study confirms ...tractor type and pH value, and their reliability depends on the soil type (Reijneveld et al., 2010). The Olsen method (Olsen et al., 1954) is used for soils with mildly acid, neutral or alkaline pH, and it has wide international acceptance as an indicator of soil P fertility (Bierman & Rosen, 1994; Ma et al., 2009; Pagliari et al., 2010 ...

CEC affects many aspects of soil chemistry, and is used as a measure of soil fertility, as it indicates the capacity of the soil to retain several nutrients (e.g. K +, NH 4 +, Ca 2+) in plant-available form. It also indicates the capacity to retain pollutant cations (e.g. Pb 2+).Soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) is often used as an important indicator of soil fertility and buffer capacity. Biochar can provide stronger adsorption capacity and greater porosity, increase the soilâs adsorption capacity for mineral elements and the value of CEC ( Liang et al., 2006 ).Cation exchange capacity ( CEC) is a measure of the soilâs ability to hold positively charged ions. It is a very important soil property influencing soil structure stability, nutrient availability, soil pH and the soilâs reaction to fertilisers and other ameliorants (Hazleton and Murphy 2007).Cation Exchange Capacity (clay) - Subsoil. Cation-exchange capacity (CEC) is the maximum quantity of total cations that a soil is capable of holding, at a given pH value, available for exchange with the soil solution. CEC is used as a measure of fertility, nutrient retention capacity, and the capacity to protect groundwater from cation ...This is the first report of a comparison of CEC values obtained by the buffered CEC (NH 4 OAC), BaCl 2 (single extraction), compulsive exchange, AgTU, and Cohex methods for a single soil sample set. We found that AgTU, compulsive exchange, and Cohex methods yielded similar eCEC values.The lowest mean CEC values were found in Spain and the highest mean values were found in the agricultural soils of Iran (38.89 cmol/kg) and Iraq (36.7 cmol/kg), followed by CEC values in forest lands (37.55 cmol/kg) in Iran (Table 1).Cation exchange capacity (CEC) characterizes soils by their ability to store and release nutrients. Cationic nutrients (Ca, Mg, K, Na, Fe, and NH 4 ) and non-nutrients (Al and H) are held on soil colloids and transported to the soil solution in an ion exchange reaction (Weil & Brady, 2016 ).CEC of a soil is dependent on the amount and type of soil colloids, clay minerals, and soil organic matter. It also reflects the total negative charge exchange sites on soil colloids ( Follett, 2001 ) and increases correspondingly with pH, % clay, and % organic matter content.Relationship between effective cation exchange capacity (CEC eff.) and soil organic carbon (SOC) content in (A) topsoils (0â30 cm depth) with soil pH < 5.5, (B) topsoils with soil pH > 5.5, (C) subsoils (30â120 cm depth) with soil pH < 5.5 and (D) subsoils with soil pH > 5.5.CEC. What is cation exchange capacity? Cation exchange capacity (CEC) indicates the ability of a soil to hold onto and exchange cations (positively charged ions) including plant nutrients such as Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and NH 4 +. The CEC is largely depend on clay content, organic matter and soil pH. CEC is a very important soil property

In numerous forest ...This paper describes a new method for the determination of correct exchangeable Ca 2+ values of calcareous clays and soils. For the method, a silverâthiourea exchange solution is saturated with Ca 2+ by treatment with fine-grained calcite prior to the start of the exchange procedure.The main ions associated with CEC in soils are the exchangeable cations calcium (Ca 2+), magnesium (Mg 2+), sodium (Na +) and potassium (K +) (Rayment and Higginson 1992), and are generally referred to as the base cations.Summary statistics of measured soil (a) exchangeable calcium (Exch.

Mg - cmol(+)/kg) for calibration and validation and at various sample size (n).Analytical methods assessment for exchangeable cations analysis in soil: MIP OES appraisement. Soil monitoring and research often requires a comparison of laboratory data generated by diverse instruments and in different laboratories to demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of the results.Cation exchange capacity (CEC) is one of the fundamental properties of soil that indicates soilâs ability to retain exchangeable cations. Several regression-based models exist to estimate CEC from widely available or easily measured basic soil properties. However, the majority of these models do not include CaCOThe aims of this study were to investigate the links between potassium (K) uptake by crops and soil K, exchangeable calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), and aluminum (Al3+) when using lime in acidic soil in southern China.

In the Gedroiz method it is assumed that in carbonate-free soils, 0-05 N HC1 does not attack unweathered mineral particles present in the soil, and that only exchangeable calcium is brought into solution, so that the same figure for exchangeable calcium should be obtained by theAlternatively, the amount of exchangeable nutrients can be estimated from agronomic soil tests (Astera, 2015; Sumner & Miller, 1996). If CEC is included in a routine soil test, farmers and advisors can use it to assess soil texture (Weil & Brady, 2016 ), plan gypsum applications (NRCS, 2015 ), and evaluate nutrient availability (Chaganti & Culman, 2018 ).

As a rule of thumb, for most crops in Cerrado soils the ratio between the levels of exchangeable Ca 2+ and exchangeable Mg 2+ (in cmol c /dm 3) in the soil should stay in the range of 1:1 till a maximum of 10:1, observing a minimum of 0.5 cmol c Mg 2+ dm â3 ( Sousa and Lobato, 2004a ).Magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca) and potassium (K) are three major and essential nutrients for plants 1. In forest ecosystems, their plant-available pools are assumed to be stored in the soil as...Mg Mg = 0.16â°) are all isotopically lighter than the basalt. These compositions can be explained by a combination of mixing and isotope fractionation processes on the soil exchange complex.Due to high variation in Mg content of the source material the total content of Mg in soils varies considerably between 0.05 and 0.5 % (Grimme 1991; Maguire and Cowan 2002 ). Differences in silicate contents of soils also explain higher Mg contents typically found in clay and silty soils compared to sandy soils.A ratio of magnesium-to-calcium > 1 in irrigation waters and an exchangeable magnesium percentage > 25% in soils are considered high enough to result in soil degradation and impact crop yields negatively.Soil pH directly affects magnesium release from clay minerals and Mg uptake by plants (Schubert et al., 1990). Exchangeable Mg at pH <6.0 becomes non-exchangeable when soil pH becomes higher than 6.5 (Chan et al., 1979; Hailes et al., 1997).Extract.

Exchangeable sodium percentage is worldwide considered to be probably the most important soil factor affecting dispersion in soils and, consequently, soil crusting. It has also in several South African studies been found to be one of the most dominant factors in soil crusting.The best indicator of soil sodicity is the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP). The ESP is usually defined as the ratio of exchangeable sodium (Exch Na) to the cation exchange capacity of the soil (CEC), both expressed in (cmolc kg â1) ( Richards, 1954 ). ESP = ExchNa CEC â 100.Soil exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) are commonly used to assess soil sodicity.

After two and a half months, the land was plowed andThe yield of cane per plot was obtained, samples of thirty whole cane stalks per plot were collected for the determination of the recoverable sucrose content, and sugar pro- duction in tons par hectare was calculated (Lemaire, 1961). Mineral elements P, K, Ca, Mg im, the juicesCane yield was obtained by weighing the whole plot and dry weight was estimated by the product of cane yield fresh weight and dry matter % obtained from cane analysis. CTL weight was taken randomly at sampling from three canes in each plot. The CTL samples were oven dried at 105 Â°C for 24 h and the dry weights were recorded. Total ...The cane yield and sugar yield of KK3 were significantly (p â¤ 0.01) higher than those of the other genotypes. The wild-type sugarcane and the F1 hybrids derived from the wild and commercial sugarcane could maintain better photosynthetic performance while encountering early drought stress.Didier et al., (2018) explained that in terms of cane production, sugarcane cultivation in rotation with legume fallows is better than the conventional monocropping system of sugarcane...The cane yield per plot was recorded at the time of harvesting. The yield per hectare was then determined using the cane yield per plot and expressed in t ha â1 . Sugarcane juice was analysed for Brix, Pol (%) and purity (%) as per standard methods of Meade and Chen ( 1977 ).This paper has described the designed sugar cane yield monitor and its performance. The results show its potential to be used in precision agriculture. Performance evaluation reports that maximum error does not exceed 6Â·4% and the mean error detected without any compensation was 4Â·3%.They reported maintaining an erect crop, by use of scaffolding, increased cane yield by 11â15% and CCS by 3â12%. Two mechanisms operate to reduce yield after partial or complete lodging. Cane quality and yield are reduced, through increased stalk death, and photosynthate accumulation is reduced. Because of the economic impact of ...

Fibre is defined slightly differently across the global group of sugar producing countries, but most often includes cellulose and hemi cellulose in cane stalk, leaf, and other organic components of the crop, in addition to any soil, sand, dirt or stones captured by the harvesting and transport activities in the field.This study aims to develop prediction models for Brix, Pol, fiber, and CCS value in cane fields by using vegetation indices calculated from canopy reflecta Sugar Yield Parameters and Fiber Prediction in Sugarcane Fields Using a Multispectral Camera Mounted on a Small Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) | SpringerLinkLosses for Fibre percentage occurred in canes are graphically shown in Figure 5. Fibre percent of cane increased with increasing the number of days. ...Hard fibre % cane varied from 3.68 to 4.46, pith % cane from 3.18 to 4.03, and total fibre % cane from 6.98 to 8.27. As mentioned earlier, the total fibre % cane values appear to be low, as do those of hard fibre % cane.Two methods for determination of fibre % cane are common in the subcontinent i.e. (1) ICUMSA official method, GS5/7-1994 and (2) bag diffusion method. Though the ICUMSA method is accurate and...Sugar cane is composed mainly of sucrose, fibre and water, usually in the proportions of about 12%, 15% and 70%, respectively (Anon., 2007), in Mauritius. The remaining constituents are other sugars (glucose and fructose), inorganic materials, nitrogenous substances, gums, waxes and organic acids (Chen and Chou, 1993).Brix is the percentage of the total content of soluble solids in the juice. Pol is also known as sucrose juice, and it is the apparent sugar content in the juice. Fibre is the percentage of water-insoluble matter of cane and bagasse, and all of the other parameters (purity, cane pol, RS, and TRS) are calculated based on the former ...The ratio of fibre to cane is commonly expressed as a percentage and is known as fibre-%. This is defined as It = CFt x 100 (%), (2) t where it is the value of fibre-%. Fibre rate is often conÂ­sidered in terms of fibre-% and cane rate, (3) Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of the first mill (Murray and Holt, 1967; Partanen et al ...The commercial variety NC0376 has a higher fibre content (14.04%) than NC0310 (12.72%). An older cane of 22 months has a higher fibre content (15.35%) than a 12- month-old cane (13.38%). In general, flowered cane has more fibre than cane which is not flowering.Several recently developed high-yield varieties of sugar cane (Saccharum spp.) with fibre content 20% higher than that of conventional cane and juice content 10% lower, have been studied.

Purity % = Sucrose % x 100 Sucrose % + Non-sucrose % Therefore, when evaluating the factors that affect cane quality, it is important to remember that: Sucrose is the valuable component of sugarcane. Fibre reduces extraction of sucrose from the cane, so keep F/S ratio as low as possible.Last Updated: 09 Sep 2023. PDF | The analysis of the quality indexes of sugarcane juice plays a vital role in the process of refining sugarcane, breeding, cultivation, and... | Find, read and cite...The most important five criteria are, namely, polarization (Pol), apparent purity, pH, viscosity, and commercial cane sugar (CCS) of the cane juice; besides dextran content of juice has been used to measure the cane deterioration.cane which include Weight Kg per ten stalks, length Kg per ten stalks, and nods of cane Kg per ten stalks, Fiber percent of cane%, Moisture content of cane%, Brix of cane (Total dissolved Solids%), Polarization (Pol.) of cane%, Purity of cane%, Reducing sugars of cane juice % and pH of cane.In GWS, the purity value dropped from 88.8% to about 56.3% during the same deterioration period, as shown in Figure 2. Purity drop has been reported in sugarcane deterioration by Datir and Joshi ...For instance, the purity of sugarcane, which can be derived from Brix and Pol values, is an important factor that determines the level of degradation of harvested cane during the cut-to-crush time, which indicates the efficiency of sugar production.In many countries, representative cane samples are taken, and detailed analyses for Brix, pol and purity are made in the laboratory. The common practice, however, is to test the standing cane in the field for Brix with a hand refractometer, which is an approximate measure of the amount of sucrose in the juice and/or cane. To obtain the Brix, a ...The paper analyzes the dynamic laws of five quality indexes (i.e., brix, purity, polarization, sucrose content,... | Sugarcane, Juice and Sugar | ResearchGate, the professional network for scientists.CC 85-92, used during the trial, had an average pol % cane of 14.5% purity and fiber % cane of 91.5% and 17.0%, respectively (Table 1). Similar results were observed for manually harvested cane (average pol % cane of 14.6 %) when cane was delivered to the factory, despite a residence time of 48 hours on fieldThere is a real need to establish new criteria to measure deterioration in Louisiana harvested cane, in order to better predict: 1) the quality of the cane to be processed, and 2) the...

Primary and secondary losses in harvested canes begin with primary losses related to direct impact on sucrose content in a natural way, while secondary losses are related to the production of secondary products and metabolites such as acids, dextran, and other substances that affect sugar recovery. In the sugar industry, the ...Based on the results, our study illustrated that the sucrose content was reduced to 1.26 units along with reduction in commercial cane sugars of 1.42 units. This is due to reduction in increase in reducing sugars, dextran, soluble acid invertase and microbial infestation in drought canes after 240 h of harvest. Furthermore, this ...The reduction in sucrose content over the time following cane har- vest results in low sugar recovery, reducing mills â economies, making post-harvest losses a topic to consider and comprehend.PDF | Sucrose losses after the harvest of sugarcane and (luring subsequent milling operation are one of the most serious problems in many sugar... | Find, read and cite all the research you need ...The quick loss of sucrose content in sugarcane from the time it is harvested has a significant impact on sugar recovery. This problem of post-harvest sucrose losses in sugarcane is a serious concern in cane-producing countries, as it not only leads to low sugar recovery in mills, but also to poor sugar refining.Effect of post-harvest sucrose losses in sugarcane a & b: Loss in sucrose content in normal and drought grown canes at an equal interval of 48 after harvest from 0 h till 240 h after harvest.Sugarcane contains high concentrations of sucrose, providing a favorable environment for the proliferation of microorganisms, which can invade the harvested sugarcane stalk through wounds or cuts . Studies have shown that more than 400 species of bacteria and fungi may be present in cuts and wounds after sugarcane harvesting [ 10 ].The crushing of harvested cane is often delayed for longer than 72 h leading to a steep decline in sucrose content, especially late in the harvest season when ambient temperatures are high. The average reductions in Commercial Cane Sugar (CCS) in untreated billets and whole cane during late harvest were 0.735 and 0.502 units/day ...Sucrose inversions in the deterioration of harvested cane result from the chemical (acid), enzymic inversion, and microbial activity. In the first 14 h of cane juice deterioration, 93.0% of sucrose losses are caused by microbial, 5.7% by enzymic, and 1.3% by chemical changes (acid degradation) .To improve yield and other traits of interest for the development of an energy cane, research must unravel the complexities of the sugarcane genome, develop statistical genetics for highly polyploid genomes and identify genes associated with sucrose content, drought resistance, biomass and cell wall recalcitrance.

Lodging at maturity was estimated visually. All plants in the central four rows of each plot, excluding the most exterior plants of each row, were used to calculate stalk lodging. Stalk lodging was the percentage of plants with broken lower internodes. Statistical AnalysesThreshing operations leave all kinds of trash mixed with the grain; they comprise both vegetable (e.g. foreign seeds or kernels, chaff, stalk, empty grains, etc.) and mineral materials (e.g. earth, stones, sand, metal particles, etc.), and can adversely affect subsequent storage and processing conditions. The cleaning operation aims at removing ...Maize is an annual grass in the family Gramineae, which includes such plants as wheat, rye, barley, rice, sorghum, and sugarcane. There are two major species of the genus Zea (out of six total): Z. mays (maize) and Z. diploperennis, which is a perennial type of teosinte.At harvest for fibres (growing stage code 2305, beginning of seed maturity), all hemp plants growing in two of the centre 8 m long rows of each plot were hand-harvested leaving stubble of about 3â5 cm. Harvest dates were 30 August 2016, 12 July 2017 and 16 July 2018. The total fresh biomass of hemp plants was determined in each ...Use the forage harvesterâs corn cracker to break all the maize grains during harvest. Maize should be chopped to 12â18 mm (0.5â0.6 in) in length. Typically, the DM% of a maize crop increases by about 2% per week at harvest time. Having assessed the DM%, the harvest date can be predicted.In a South Carolina study, researchers planted intercrops of southern peas and sweet corn at three different corn plant populations . The plantings were on raised beds with flat and wide crowns on six-foot centers. In the center of each bed was a cornrow with two rows of peas planted 18 inches to either side of the cornrow (see Figure 1). The ...HRR consisted of cutting stalks 0.15 m from the ground and removing residue. Individual plot dimensions were 30 Ã 30 m under a no-tillage soil management. Each year, both corn and soybean phases of the rotation were present. In the fall of 2005, the residue removal treatments were split, and a cover crop treatment (with or without ...Cereal stem, leaf, and sheath material accounts for two-thirds of all residual phytomass, and sugar cane tops and leaves are the second-largest contributor. Just over 60% of all residual phytomass is produced in low-income countries, and close to 45% of it originates in the tropics.Within 18 to 24 months after planting, two or three of the plant stalks in each mat are ready for harvesting, and two to four stalks can be harvested at intervals of four to six months thereafter. The stalk, with its surrounding petioles, is cut off close to the ground, usually at the time of blossoming. Abaca plants are generally replaced ...The stalks of the plant are caught up in the augers and transported to the back of the machine via straw walkers, eventually the stalks are expelled out of the back of the machine. Leaving the vegetative plant parts in the field helps increase organic matter content in the soil and returns nutrients to the ground as the plant breaks ...

With a full PGR programme (applied during early and late stem extension), benchmark stem heights (to the highest ligule/collar or base of the ear) are: GS31 = 9 cm (related to leaf sheath length) GS39 = 34 cm (around 50% of final height)Pseudo-stem (formed by sheaths of leaves) strongly erected. Stem Extension 6: First node of stem visible at base of shoot. 7: Second node of stem formed; next-to-last leaf just visible. 8: Flag leaf (last leaf) visible but still rolled up; ear beginning to swell. 9: Ligule of flag leaf just visible. 10Feekes 9.0: Ligule of Flag Leaf Visible (early May) Stage 9.0 begins when the flag leaf is fully emerged from the whorl with the ligule visible (Figure 5). From this point on, leaves are referred to in relation to the flag leaf (i.e., the first leaf below the flag leaf is the F-1, the second leaf below is the F-2, and so forth).Figure 19.5. Parts of the grass leaf: ligule. In some species, the leaf blade will show distinct veins when held against the light as seen in meadow fescue. Other important characteristics include stem base colouration which are red/pink in the ryegrasses. Stem/root features can be important when identifying non-sown grass species.Spike growth, slow in its early stages, increases greatly about the time the ligule of the flag leaf becomes visible (Krumm et al., 1990). Floret abortion starts in the boot stage and finishes at anthesis. Floret death occurs when the stem and peduncle are at maximum growth rate (Siddique et al., 1989). Floret death is probably, at least ...The microphylls of Lycopodiophyta of the families Selaginellaceae (spikemosses or lesser clubmosses) and Isoetaceae (quillworts) have minute, scale-like flaps of tissue called ligules at the base of the upper surface of each leaf blade. This feature distinguishes them from clubmosses of the family Lycopodiaceae.

(1963) indicate that sucrose is the major carbohydrate transported in the phloem. In the sink tissues, sucrose is unloaded from the phloem. Several pathways of unloading have been described ( Patrick, 1997 ).Sweet sorghum has emerged as a promising source of bioenergy mainly due to its high biomass and high soluble sugar yield in stems. Studies have shown that loss-of-function <i>Dry</i> locus alleles have been selected during sweet sorghum domestication, and decapitation can further boost sugar accumul â¦Roots of sugar beet and stems of sugarcane and sweet sorghum are the primary tissues to accumulate high levels of sugars, mainly sucrose. These tissues are sink tissues receiving photosynthetic products from source tissues through phloem transport.More importantly, our results demonstrated that the phenotype of high sugar content is inheritable and shed light on improvement for other sugar crops.Additionally, some studies showed that SWEET transporters perform their functions in the stem. In this study, the quantitative expression of SlSWEETs in the tomato stem during mature green (MG) and RR stages were analyzed. We found that SlSWEET11b (Solyc03g097570) had the highest overall expression level in the stem.Sugars, especially glucose and fructose, contribute to the taste and quality of tomato fruits.

Our method can work on point clouds generated from three types of 3D imaging platforms, and also suitable for different kinds of plant species. In experiments, it obtainsEach leaf typically has a leaf blade ( lamina ), stipules, a midrib, and a margin. Some leaves have a petiole, which attaches the leaf to the stem; leaves that do not have petioles are directly attached to the plant stem and are called sessile leaves.In most plants, stems are located above the soil surface, but some plants have underground stems. Stems have several main functions: Support for and the elevation of leaves, flowers, and fruits. The stems keep the leaves in the light and provide a place for the plant to keep its flowers and fruits.Leaves are generally composed of a few main parts: the blade and the petiole. Figure 13.1.2 13.1. 2: A leaf is usually composed of a blade and a petiole. The blade is most frequently the flat, photosynthetic part. The petiole is a stem that attaches the leaf blade to the main stem of the plant.We identify this as a joint multi-leaf segmentation, alignment, and tracking problem. First, leaf segmentation and alignment are applied on the last frame of a plant video to ï¬nd a number of well-aligned leaf candidates. Second, leaf tracking is applied on the remaining frames with leaf candidate transformation from the previous frame.A leaf (pl.: leaves) is a principal appendage of the stem of a vascular plant, usually borne laterally aboveground and specialized for photosynthesis.Leaves are collectively called foliage, as in "autumn foliage", while the leaves, stem, flower, and fruit collectively form the shoot system. In most leaves, the primary photosynthetic tissue is the palisade mesophyll and is located on the upper ...Typically, a leaf consists of a broad expanded blade (the lamina), attached to the plant stem by a stalklike petiole. In angiosperms leaves commonly have a pair of structures known as stipules, which are located on each side of the leaf base and may resemble scales, spines, glands, or leaflike structures. Leaves are, however, quiteThe top one, the apical meristem, accounts for growth in the stem. The lower one, the intercalary meristem, produces leaf primordia. The leaf primordia eventually divides into two systems that develop leaf blades and leaf sheaths. Growth of leaf blades begins with cells dividing but eventually is mainly from cell elongation. The pacing of leaf ...

Impact of soluble sugar concentrations on the acquisition of freezing tolerance in accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana with contrasting cold adaptation â evidence for a role of raffinose in cold acclimation - KLOTKE - 2004 - Plant, Cell & Environment - Wiley Online Library.In today's context, the survival of plants under environmental stress is an extensive area of research. In addition, increase in the concentration of soluble sugars such as, glucose, sucrose and fructose enhances plant tolerance to several abiotic stresses, such as drought, salinity and cold (Rathinasabapathi, 2000).Sensing intracellular soluble sugar pathways, however, provides incomplete information about the metabolic status of plant cells, since they ignore the concentration of soluble sugars in the apoplast and, perhaps more importantly, the apoplast-cytosol and the vacuole-cytosol fluxes of sugars. Consequently, a complex signalling network underlying to sugar-sensing pathways is present.The content and the ratio of soluble sugars and organic acids in fruits are significant indicators for fruit quality. They are affected by multiple environmental factors, in which water-deficient is the most concern. Previous studies found that the content of soluble sugars and organic acids in fruit displayed great differences under ...Soluble sugars are metabolic substrates that play a fundamental role in controlling several processes in diverse plant developmental phases. Sugars such as glucose, sucrose and fructose are reported throughout the plant kingdom and have a dominant role in structure and metabolism at the cellular and whole-plant level.The purpose of this study was to explore the mechanism of ABA-induced freezing tolerance increase in grapevines.

Main processes determining soluble sugar concentration were decomposed into sugar importation, metabolism and water dilution with the process-based analysis. Different ...Fruit species also showed a large diversity in soluble sugar concentration at maturity, with grape having the highest soluble sugar concentrations (16.5 to 26.3 g/100 g FW), followed by peach (2.2 to 20 g/100 g FW), cherry tomato (3.5 to 6.1 g/100 g FW), and tomato (1.4 to 5 g/100 g FW; Figure 1 ).The response of soluble sugar and starch concentrations to drought (>30 days of no water) were analysed separately as the ratio of the observed concentration in each organ after drought over the average concentration of each organ in the control.The concentration of soluble sugars of the sweet corn hybrids (186â261 g kg â1 DM, Fig. 2a) was in the range of the sweet sorghum varieties evaluated by Zhao et al.

Specifically, in certain environments, the soil has the capacity to maintain the C content within a relatively stable range; when the soil C content is higher or lower than this range, the C content tends to return to this range.Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the largest carbon (C) stock in most terrestrial ecosystems (Lal, 2008a), containing approximately 2344 Gt of organic C globally (Stockmann et al., 2013). Moreover, soil is recognized as the second largest C pool after the oceans and one of the most important components of the biosphere, delivering major ecosystem ...This briefing presents the information on soil carbon that can be extracted from the 2021 national greenhouse gas inventories, as reported by EU Member States for the year 2019. It also gives an overview on the status of soil carbon pools across Europe.The organic C contents ranged from 9.3 to 120.6 g C kg â1, and forest soils had the highest SOC contents (50 Â± 4 g kg â1 soil), followed by grasslands (38 Â± 3 g kg â1 soil) and...Carbon saturation model. The C saturation model has a whole soil saturation limit ( C m ) (Fig. 2 b) due to inherent physicochemical limitations. In contrast to the linear model, the fundamental relationship between C addition levels and soil C levels at steady-state is asymptotic.Soil C content can be determined by the coefficients of humus and organic matter entering soil, while N is derived from the biological nitrogen fixation or entering soil through precipitation, and the main sources of P are leaching and rock weathering (Ding et al., 2012).Carbon (C) input is a prerequisite for the formation of soil organic matter and thus for soil organic C (SOC) sequestration. Here we used the C-TOOL model to simulate SOC changes in a long-term ...Soil organic carbon tends to be concentrated in the topsoil. Topsoil ranges from 0.5% to 3.0% organic carbon for most upland soils. Soils with less than 0.5% organic C are mostly limited to desert areas. Soils containing greater than 12â18% organic carbon are generally classified as organic soils.Soil carbonates (inorganic C mainly as CaCO) account for about 750 Gt C in the top 1 m and more than 2300 Gt in the top 2 m (nearly equal to organic C stocks). These inorganic C stocks have millennial to million-year turnover times and protect natural soils from degradation.The stock of C in the mineral soil was calculated for each depth (Cstock 0-10, Cstock 10-20, Cstock 20-30 and Cstock 30-40) following the next formula: \({Cstock}_{i}=TOCi*bDi*EFi*Ti\) being i: soil depth (0â10 cm, 10â20 cm, 20â30 cm or 30â40 cm), TOC: total organic carbon content (%), bD: bulk density (g cm â3), EF: earth ...

Introduction Potassium is an essential macronutrient for plants, animals and human health and consequently plays a crucial role as one of the basic factors of soil productivity.lack of potassium in soil and to reduce the injurious eects induced by salinity stress and high Cd levels on the growth and yield of wheat, appropriate K management strategies in wheat cropping systems are required. Rate and time of K application are key factors aecting the use eciency of applied K. These factors would be considered in formulat-Potassium (K) is an essential nutrient for plant growth. Because large amounts are absorbed from the root zone in the production of most agronomic crops, it is classified as a macronutrient....The applications consisted of five potassium (K 2 O) fertilization rates: 0 (K 0) as control, 60 (K 60), 120 (K 120), 180 (K 180), and 240 (K 240) kgÂ·hm â2 of K 2 O. Nitrogen (150 kgÂ·hm â2 of N) and phosphorus (90 kgÂ·hm â2 of P 2 O 5) fertilizers were applied, of which the N, P, and K were urea (42% N), superphosphate (12% P ...Environment and management. Bijay-Singh, Tek B. Sapkota, in Encyclopedia of Soils in the Environment (Second Edition), 2023. Potassium. Potassium fertilizers are applied to most agricultural soils because most soil K (10 to 20 g kg â 1 soil) is only potentially available for plant uptake. In terms of plant availability and complex dynamics in the soil, K can be differentiated into four soil ...a Application rates of chemical fertilizers, N: P 2 O 5: K 2 O; Krw, recommend K fertilization rate, K was applied both at rice and wheat season; CK, no K fertilizer applied; 70%Krw, K fertilizer rate was 70% of Krw, K was applied both at rice and wheat season; Kr, K fertilizer was used only at rice phase, the K rate was equal to the annual ...In this study, release and fixation rates of K (kg haâ 1 yr â 1) were estimated in five long-term field experiments located on varying parent materials in South and Central Sweden, each having an array of K fertilizer application rates.Potassium was added in soil at the recommended rate for all the treatments combining mineral fertilizers with K-feldspar and biofertilizers, while foliar spraying included the application of potassium citrate (PC), potassium silicate (PS), and monopotassium phosphate (MP). The obtained results showed that plant height was highest ...Next, as corrective fertilization, an application rate of 183 kg ha â1 of P was applied in the form of monobasic calcium phosphate (11.6% of P), according to Sousa and Lobato . Soil chemical parameters before and after acidity correction and P correction fertilization are presented in Table 4.

Nitrogen (N) fertilizer-induced soil acidification in Chinese croplands is well-known, but insight in the impacts of different N fertilizer management approaches (fertilizer type and rate) on soil acidification rates is very limited.Nitrogen application rates of < 150 kg ha â1 or 150â225 kg ha â1 were most effective under the three nitrogen application depths (Fig. 11), thereby indicating that low or medium nitrogen application rates could meet the crop growth requirements under deep nitrogen application, which is consistent with previous studies (Cheng et ...The N application rate between 1961 and 2020 for rice, vegetables and fruits showed the highest growth rate, increasing by 237.6%, 175.6%, and 252.3%, respectively, compared to wheat (152.2%...Nitrogen fertilization can increase soil organic C and N by increasing crop biomass yield, and the amount of residue returned to the soil . Russell et al. , however, reported no difference in soil organic C with N fertilization rate.To benefit banana agronomy and environment, the N application rate of 352 g N per plant could be suggested as the optimal N application rate in this region. Conclusion We demonstrated that different N application rates had great impacts on soil properties and banana leaf physiological attributes.A 2-year field experiment was conducted on the North China Plain to assess the effects of two straw management practices and different nitrogen fertilizer addition levels on soil organic matter (SOM) fractions and microbial properties under a winter wheat-summer maize cropping system.The field experiment consisted of five different split nitrogen fertilizer applications at an application rate of 240 kgâha â1 (basal/dressing, 100/0%, 70/30%, 50/50%, 30/70%, 0/100%; hereafter referred to as N1, N2, N3, N4, and N5, respectively) with a randomized plot design ( Table 1 ).Our work demonstrates that the 100-seed-weight of B1N1 (biochar application rate at 3 kgÂ·mâ2, nitrogen application rate at 75 kgÂ·haâ1) increased by 6.55% compared with that of the control. Meanwhile, we have confirmed that the leaf nitrogen contents can accurately predict the changes in NO3â-N in soil at a depth of 10â20 cm ...The highest mean SR value (1.75 mg CO 2 g â1 soil) was found under the highest N application rate (180 kg N ha â1) followed by the 90 kg N ha â1 rate, and these values were significantly higher than the 45 kg N ha â1 and 0 kg N ha â1 application rates .The results showed that, through the irrigation of 93 to 102, 92 to 98 and 92 to 98 mm, along with nitrogen applications of 65 to 71, 64 to 73 and 72 to 81 kg/hm2 at 17, 59 and 87 days after ...

Under sufficient N and K fertilization, P may modestly increase yield by 10â20% across crops and soils. Accordingly, such minimal effect could be justification for using half of the recommended P application rate (Valkama et al. 2009) under sufficient N and K conditions.The relative availability of soil P is highest at soil pH levels of 5 to 7 33,34, which would imply that around this pH fertiliser P application would yield the strongest responses.The objective of this study was to determine the suitable range of available phosphorus (P) and fertilizer application rate in a sugarcane-growing region with red soil in southern China. Thirty-five monitoring sites were selected to investigate the soil available P in relation to crop yield, P-use efficiency (PUE) and soil total P ...The farmyard manure (FYM, mainly comes from cow excretion) was applied with 75 t ha â1 year â1 on a dry basis, where the P content in the FYM was 2.4 g kg â1 per year from the application rate (equivalent to 180 kg P ha â1). All fertilizers were subsequently mixed and applied as a basal dose 5â7 days before sowing (Guo et ...This analysis addresses the effects of fertilizer-P placement on soil P reactions, P uptake, growth, yield, and yield components for the four crops.

Empty fruit bunch (EFB) from oil palm is one of the potential biomass to produce biofuels like bio-oil due to its abundant supply and favorable physicochemical characteristics. Confirming the assertion, this paper presents an overview of EFB as a feedstock for bio-oil production. The fundamental characteristics of EFB in terms of ...Empty fruit bunches (EFBs) â a second-gen biomass â are the remains of fresh fruit bunches after the fruit has been stripped for oil processing. Brassica carinata â known as novel feedstock â is a cover crop that flowers in between planting seasons.Fresh Biomass of Fruit Components. Fresh biomasses of Lot 1, Lot 2, Lot 3, and Lot 4 of S. madagascariensis fruits were 18375.9 g, 17717.4 g, 18014.9 g, and 17535.9 g, respectively. This represented on average 17911.1 g for these four lots (Table 2). The mean fresh biomasses of the shell, pulp, and seeds of the four lots (each with 50 fruits ...Expressed in units per ton of FFB, in general waste generated from the CPO extraction process consists of empty fruit bunches (OPEFB) of 22%, mesocarp fiber of 13%, shell of 6%, and liquid waste called palm oil mill effluent (POME) of 0.6-0.8 m3 (Hasanudin et al., 2015).Oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) are oil palm biomass that can be processed into organic amendments and energy sources. Currently, the methods to utilize these solid waste have become a concern because it is related to the implementation of the zero-waste concept.Empty fruit bunches (EFBs) is one of the potential biomass wastes, which can be utilized as a raw material for bioethanol production. The high availability of EFBs as a biowaste in Malaysia can endorse the concept of waste-to-wealth that had been long dreamed since late 1990, where unwanted wastes are converted into valuable energy.Oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) are the largest solid waste with a fraction of around 20-23% of fresh fruit bunches. Conventionally, it is only used as plant mulch in plantations areas. However, this biomass can still provide added value to bioenergy products through thermochemical pyrolysis conversion.

In addition, the findings demonstrated that biomass recalcitrance increased ...Download scientific diagram | Soluble sugar concentrations (Î¼mol/g FW) in young (internode 3; I3) and mature (internode 9; I9) stalk sections harvested from independent trials including...No study of soluble sugar levels in S. viridis culms has been published; however, Brix concentrations of up to ten can be achieved (Martin et al. unpublished observations), which is equivalent to that of mid-range sweet sorghum and sugarcane crops.The present method can reliably estimate mixed sugars composed of 80% sucrose. We characterized the profiles of 35 sorghum accessions and identified 21 accessions with significantly different sugar concentrations between internodes either due to dried-up internodes or concentration differences.A new high-throughput methodology was developed for screening large variable populations of S. bicolor for biomass, soluble sugar concentrations, and cell wall composition using a volumetric correlation between the fourth internode from the base of the stalk that had expanded more than 2 cm, to that of the whole stalk (Figure 1).As the production of soluble sugar by sweet sorghum depends on extractable juice quantity and sweetness (Burks et al. 2015), further insight must be provided to the way stay-green ability influences sugar partitioning in internodes along the stem depending on plant water status.Della and Rio showed similarities in internode sugar concentration dynamics in several aspects. First, the total sugar concentrations were markedly increased in both genotypes from anthesis to 38 DAF (from ~ 9 to ~ 18% in Della and from ~ 12 to ~ 19% in Rio; Fig. 2d). Second, the upper internodes (internode 2â8 for Rio and ...The commonly used sugar measurement, Brix, limits the characterization of internode variation of the sugar concentrations due to its low throughput. Here we developed a low-cost, high-throughput ...

Leaf area index (LAI) is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes plant canopies. It is defined as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground surface area (LAI = leaf area / ground area, m 2 / m 2) in broadleaf canopies. In conifers, three definitions for LAI have been used: Half of the total needle surface area per unit ground ...Leaf Area Index. The Leaf Area Index is defined as half the total area of green elements of the canopy per unit horizontal ground area. The satellite-derived value corresponds to the total green LAI of all the canopy layers, including the understory which may represent a very significant contribution, particularly for forests. Practically, the ...Lâindice foliaire, ou indice de surface foliaire (LAI, en anglais Leaf Area Index), est une grandeur sans dimension qui exprime la surface foliaire dâun arbre, dâun peuplement, dâun Ã©cosystÃ¨me ou dâun biome par unitÃ© de surface de sol. Il est dÃ©terminÃ© par l'estimation de la surface supÃ©rieure de l'intÃ©gralitÃ© des ...Leaf area index is defined as the projected area of leaves over a unit of land (m 2 m â2), so one unit of LAI is equivalent to 10,000 m 2 of leaf area per hectare. Sometimes LAI is expressed on the basis of all leaf surfaces. For broadleaf trees, the total is twice the projected area; for needle-leaf trees the conversion is between 2.4 and 2.6Leaf area index (LAI) quantifies the amount of leaf material in a canopy. By definition, it is the ratio of one-sided leaf area per unit ground area. LAI is unitless because it is a ratio of areas. For example, a canopy with an LAI of 1 has a 1:1 ratio of leaf area to ground area (Figure 1a). A canopy with an leaf area index of 3 would have a 3 ...Abstract. Leaf area index (LAI) is a critical vegetation structural variable and is essential in the feedback of vegetation to the climate system. The advancement of the global Earth Observation has enabled the development of global LAI products and boosted global Earth system modeling studies.The leaf area index (LAI) is the projected leaf area per unit of ground surface area (Watson , 1947). This is a dimensionless quantity and is the equivalent to mÂ² of leaves per mÂ² of soil (LAI = leaf area / ground area, m2 / m2). Leaf area index varies from 2 in some pine forests to 5-7 in closed stands, but it is not uncommon to measure ...Leaf area index (LAI) is the total oneâsided area of leaf tissue per unit ground surface area. It is a key parameter in ecophysiology, especially for scaling up the gas exchange from leaf to canopy level. It characterizes the canopyâatmosphere interface, where most of the energy fluxes exchange. It is also one of the most ...Leaf area index (LAI) is a critical vegetation structural variable and is essential in the feedback of vegetation to the climate system. The advancement of the global Earth Observation has enabled the development of global LAI products and boosted global Earth system modeling studies.

Leaves are generally composed of a few main parts: the blade and the petiole. Figure 13.1.2 13.1. 2: A leaf is usually composed of a blade and a petiole. The blade is most frequently the flat, photosynthetic part. The petiole is a stem that attaches the leaf blade to the main stem of the plant.Graph based method is proposed for leaf region segmentation. Circular Hough Transform is used to count the number of leaves in plant images. Abstract. This paper proposes an efficient method to extract the leaf region and count the number of leaves in digital plant images.Each leaf typically has a leaf blade ( lamina ), stipules, a midrib, and a margin. Some leaves have a petiole, which attaches the leaf to the stem; leaves that do not have petioles are directly attached to the plant stem and are called sessile leaves.In most plants, stems are located above the soil surface, but some plants have underground stems. Stems have several main functions: Support for and the elevation of leaves, flowers, and fruits. The stems keep the leaves in the light and provide a place for the plant to keep its flowers and fruits.These leaf meristems coordinate the orientation of the cell division plate, produce the main compartments of the leaf (the leaf blade and leaf petiole), and determine the proximal-distal gradient where the switch from cell proliferation to cell differentiation occurs in developing leaves (Donnelly et al., 1999; Ichihashi et al., 2011).A total of 1123 records for total leaf, total stem, and total plant size (M L, M S, and M T, respectively) and 548 records for plant height and DBH complied by Cannell (1982); Enquist and Niklas (2002), and Niklas and Enquist (2002a,b) were analyzed. The data included measurement taken on eudicot, monocot, and conifer species, and ...We identify this as a joint multi-leaf segmentation, alignment, and tracking problem. First, leaf segmentation and alignment are applied on the last frame of a plant video to ï¬nd a number of well-aligned leaf candidates. Second, leaf tracking is applied on the remaining frames with leaf candidate transformation from the previous frame.angiosperm. Table of Contents. Angiosperm - Stems, Photosynthesis, Reproduction: The stem conducts water and minerals from the roots and food from the site of synthesis to various parts. The angiosperm leaf consists of a leaf base, two stipules, a petiole, and a blade.A few mutants such as broad leaf 1 (blf1) and gigas (gig) produce large leaf blades that are up to twice the normal width. In contrast, the angustifolium-a (fol-a) and narrow leaf dwarf (nld) mutants have small, narrow leaf blades. The brachytic (brh) mutants often have relatively short leaf blades.Each image was labeled in two annotation levels. The first is the number of leaves, and the second is a leaf center dot annotation. The size of the images varies between 441 Ã 441 and 2, 448 Ã 2, 048, and they were resized to 800 Ã W where W was chosen to keep the original aspect ratio. To enrich the datasets, random transformations were ...

Open in figure viewer PowerPoint. Allocation in relation to total plant dry mass (TDM). (aâc) The fractional allocation to leaves (LMF), stems (SMF) and roots (RMF), respectively, for herbaceous species. (dâf) The fractional allocation to leaves, stems and roots, respectively, for woody species.There is convincing evidence for a scaling relationship between leaf dry weight ( DW) and leaf surface area ( A) for broad-leaved plants, and most estimates of the scaling exponent of DW vs. A are greater than unity. However, the scaling relationship of leaf fresh weight ( FW) vs. A has been largely neglected.Estimation of leaf dry biomass from the product of leaf dimensions. The correlations, linear regression and polynomial models between leaf dry biomass and the product of leaf dimensions are presented in Fig. 4. Most of the best models obtained were polynomial models with a logarithmic transformation of the data.Reduced major axis regression was used to fit the log-transformed data of leaf biomass and area, and the bootstrap percentile method was used to test the significance of the difference between...We compared abundance-weighted values of two of the most widely used traits from the leaf economics spectrum (specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content) with measured aNPP across a temperate ecosystem gradient. We found that leaf dry matter content (LDMC) as opposed to specific leaf area (SLA) was the superior predictor of aNPP ...Dry weight biomass measurements with electronic balance. Overview. Total dry mass is often used as an indication of plant fitness. In particular, dry vegetative mass is generally correlated to reproductive mass. In addition, the plant samples may be split into leaves, stems and roots. This enables calculation of the root to shoot ratio, and ...Two different equations were determined to estimate leaf area and dry biomass from leaf dimensions. The relation between leaf area (A) and the product of length (L) Ã width (Wi) was defined by the linear equation A = 0.60 Ã L Ã Wi whereas dry biomass (We) was predicted by a power law We = 0.004 Ã (L Ã Wi)1.11. This method could ...Leaf dry matter content (ratio of leaf dry mass to leaf saturated mass) is an index of mass investment in photosynthetic organs that is positively correlated with leaf density and negatively correlated with leaf [N] and plant growth (Garnier et al., 2004; Polley, Yang, et al., 2020a).The relationship between leaf area and plant biomass was found to be non-linear and variable depending on carbon partitioning. The model output was sensitive to the rate of photosynthesis but more sensitive to the amount of carbon partitioned to growing thicker leaves.Specific leaf area (SLA) was calculated as the leaf area per unit dry leaf mass. Measurement of biomass and productivity allocation to absorptive root and leaf We measured the diameter (at breast height) of 26â38 trees for two consecutive years at each site.

Allocation to leaves (a), stems (b) and roots (c) in various biomes of the world. For some biomes, there is a paucity of studies distinguishing between leaf, stem and root biomass. In these cases, we added additional observations for which vegetation was separated into above- and below-ground biomass, from which the root mass ...Reduced major axis regression was used to fit the log-transformed data of leaf biomass and area, and the bootstrap percentile method was used to test the significance of the difference between...The model showed that maximizing leaf area growth by small reductions in C partitioning to leaf thickening with subsequent increments to leaf area growth, during early stages of vegetative growth has profoundly positive effects on leaf area, leaf mass, and plant biomass as seen in gi-2.âDiminishing returnsâ in leaf economics occurs when increases in lamina mass (M), which can either be represented by lamina dry mass (DM) or fresh mass (FM), fail to produce proportional increases in leaf surface area (A), such that the scaling exponent (Î±) for the M vs. A scaling relationship exceeds unity (i.e., Î± > 1.0 ...The scaling relationship for leaf fresh mass vs. leaf area was statistically robust for each of the six species, and the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the Î± was greater than 1.0 for all six species (Fig. 4). Likewise, the R 2 exceeded 0.90 in all species.To test whether there are general patterns in biomass partitioning in relation to environmental variation when stand biomass is considered, we investigated biomass allocation in leaves, stems...Fresh leaf samples were killed using an oven at 105Â°C and dried at 65Â°C to a constant weight, then weighed for dry weight and the biomass of the needle leaves was calculated. 2.3. Determination of biomass of leaf per plantLeaf dry mass per unit area (LMA) is considered to represent the photosynthetic capacity, which actually implies a hypothesis that foliar water mass (leaf fresh weight minus leaf dry weight) is proportional to leaf dry weight during leaf growth.The truncation treatment described here represents a promising rejuvenation technique for increasing leaf size, fresh weight (FW), photosynthetic capacity, and leaf biomass and delaying senescence in G. biloba. In addition, increasing the production of bioactive flavonoids in medicinal plant species is desirable. We found that the ...This paper describes a simple technique for the fermentation of untreated or partly-treated leafy biomass in a digester of novel design without incurring the normal problems of feeding, floating and scum formation of feed, etc.

Here, we investigated the sugar content, gene expression, and the activity of sucrose-metabolizing enzymes in the leaves of Hevea brasiliensis, a tropical tree widely cultivated for natural rubber. Sucrose, fructose and glucose were the major sugars detected in Hevea leaves at four developmental stages (I to IV), with starch and ...Soluble sugar and starch concentrations in the leaves increased or decreased immediately after the temperature was reduced or raised. A strong gradient of changes was observed for up to 36 h and 60 h in soluble sugars and starch, respectively.Soluble sugars trigger the proliferation of organs and produce larger and thicker leaves, increases the size and number of tubers and adventitious roots (Gibson, 2005). It has been reported when sucrose is present in higher concentration in potatoes leads to increase the number of tubers (Gibson, 2005).We measured the concentration of starch, soluble sugar, NSC, and the soluble sugar:starch ratio in leaves, twigs, trunks and roots of twenty dominant species for dry and wet season in monsoon ...Similar elevations in soluble sugar concentrations of leaves in response to flooding were observed in Acosmium nitens (Vog.) Benth., Eschweilera tenuifolia, Campsiandra laurifolia, and Symmeria paniculata Benth., accompanied in all cases by elevated leaf starch concentrations (Rengifo et al. 2005). In contrast to the rather substantial effects of flooding observed, seedling responses to short ...Increased concentration of soluble sugars triggered the propagation of organs and produced larger and thicker leaves (Gibson, 2005). High sugar accumulation caused increase in the size and number of tubers in potatoes, enhanced adventitious roots formation in Arabidopsis , and also promoted cell division and cell expansion and ...Sensing intracellular soluble sugar pathways, however, provides incomplete information about the metabolic status of plant cells, since they ignore the concentration of soluble sugars in the apoplast and, perhaps more importantly, the apoplast-cytosol and the vacuole-cytosol fluxes of sugars. Consequently, a complex signalling network underlying to sugar-sensing pathways is present.Soluble sugars (mono- and disaccharides) play a main role in the assembly and functioning of all living cells. Their origin gives the impression to be firmly connected with prebiotic and primary biotic evolution (Hazra et al. 2019 ).The soluble sugar/starch ratio of C. lanceolate decreased with increasing shading degree, whereas that of S. superb remained stable. Leaf C:N ratio decreased while N:P ratio increased with increasing shading degree; leaf C:P ratio was highest in 60% shading degree for C. lanceolata and in 40% shading degree for S. superba. S. superba ...From many aspects including plantsâ perception of water stress signal, signal conversion and transmission, induced gene expression, the changes in soluble sugar and the enzyme activities of organic acids, as well as the final sugar and acid content in fruits, this thesis summarized previous studies on the influence of water stress ...

This study evaluated the effect of a dairy system involving grazing over the winter on a soil surface N balance (SSB) and soluble N content in a clay loam soil in comparison with early spring calving systems. The SSBs were calculated for each paddock within three dairy systems for 2 years.Soil water content affects the moisture and amount of nutrients available to plants and soil aeration status. Soil water content can be measured on a mass or volume basis. Gravimetric soil water content is the mass of water in the soil, measured as the difference between the moist soil and the soil dried at 105Â°C, known as the oven-dry weight ...Vocabulary. Soil contains air, water, and minerals as well as plant and animal matter, both living and dead. These soil components fall into two categories. In the first category are biotic factorsâall the living and once-living things in soil, such as plants and insects.It was found that soil organic matter (SOM) and silt content were the main factors to determine cation exchange capacity and specific surface area. Both cation exchange capacity and specific surface area were closely related to silt content but weakly related to clay content, possibly due to the high silt content in our studied soils ...Each land use category includes two soil categories â mineral soil and organic soil.

Because wells are not always drilled vertically, there may be two "depths" for every given point in a wellbore: the measured depth (MD) measured along the path of the borehole, and the true vertical depth (TVD), the vertical distance between the datum and the point of interest.1. n. [Drilling] The vertical distance from a point in the well (usually the current or final depth) to a point at the surface, usually the elevation of the rotary kelly bushing (RKB). This is one of two primary depth measurements used by the drillers, the other being measured depth.Typically, the maximum inclination is reduced to zero at Dt with drop radius R1, derived in the same manner as the build radius, R.

schemes ensures reduced smearing without impairing convergence property. TVD schemes develop formulae for interpolation of a cell-face value of the transported variable. If the interpolated value is bounded by the neighbouring nodal values then the scheme is âBoundedâ. However, not all TVD schemes possess this property of âBoundednessâ. Thethis paper we propose some natural limitations on the interpolated values between two mesh points and we establish in the third part su cient conditions that prove that the resulting scheme is TVD.A TVD scheme with alternating compressive and diffusive limiters (TVDal) is proposed for modeling the advection process. â¢ Numerical errors can be reduced by approximately 60% based on benchmark tests using TVDal. â¢ TVDal combining with splitting methods is used to model multiple dimensional advection.In this study, a one-dimensional TVD scheme was applied to the unstructured mesh. Far upwind cell needed in the TVD formulation was replaced with auxiliary cells. The auxiliaryâs cell is defined in such a way that it also acts as a spatial correction for mesh skewness.A numerical scheme is presented for accurate simulation of fluid flow using the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) on unstructured mesh. A finite volume approach is adopted to discretize the LBE on a cell-centered, arbitrary shaped, triangular tessellation.Higher-order TVD interpolation in multi-dimension is developed.

This indicates a drought-driven decrease in both root and shoot biomass, and a stronger negative response of shoots ( t -test, P < 0.001).Only a few studies use field-scale crop models coupled with a root architectural model. Mboh et al. (2018) analyzed the impact of improved RLD simulations due to coupling of a field scale model with a 3D root model on above-ground biomass (AGB) and yield of drought-stressed spring wheat in Germany.Dry weight biomass of sampled trees was estimated with different component: (1) stem wood; (2) stem bark; (3) sawdust; (4) stem (1+2+3); (5) large branches; (6) small branches and foliage; (7) crown (5+6); (8) aboveground biomass (4+7); (9) rootball; (10) medium roots; (11) belowground biomass (9+10); and (12) whole tree (8+11).Our objective was to test these two alternative hypotheses across a water availability gradient.

The SPAD-502 meter is a hand-held device that is widely used for the rapid, accurate and non-destructive measurement of leaf chlorophyll concentrations. It has been employed extensively in both research and agricultural applications, with a range of different plant species.In general, hand-held chlorophyll meters measure absorbance by the leaf of two different wavelengths in the spectral domain of red and near-infrared. As an output, they calculate index-values (e.g. SPAD- value, CCI-value) that specify leaf chlorophyll content.SPAD measurements. SPAD values of the four fully expanded uppermost leaves were determined at the TI, PI, and HD growth stages. The first, second, third, and fourth fully expanded leaves from the top of the plant were designated as LFT1â4, respectively. SPAD readings were taken at three locations: (a) 1/3 of the distance from the ...In this study, the SPAD value was predicted by calculating the spectral fractal dimension index (SFDI) from a hyperspectral curve (420 to 950 nm). The correlation between the SPAD value and hyperspectral information was further analyzed for determining the sensitive bands that correspond to different disease levels.

We used a variety of independent variables that range in scale from the branch to plot level.Plot-level biomass estimates were combined with Landsat imagery and geomorphometric and climate layers to map aboveground tree biomass. We compared biomass estimates for individual trees, plots, and at the landscape-scale using our locally-developed allometric equations, nationwide equations applied across the U.S., and the Forest ...In estimating the forest biomass carbon and its response under climate change, the issue of scaling has resulted in difficulties when modelling the biomass for different-sized trees, especially...The relation between leaf area ( A) and the product of length ( L ) Ã width (Wi) was defined by the linear equation A = 0.60 Ã L Ã Wi whereas dry biomass (We) was predicted by a power law We = 0.004 Ã ( L Ã Wi) 1.11. This method could also be tested and applied to other species. IntroductionBiomass estimation is one of the crucial tasks of forest ecology. Drying tree material is a crucial stage of preparing biomass estimation tools. However, at this step researchers use different...This study has quantitatively mapped the distributions and peak above-ground foliar biomass of the 1000 most prevalent plant and tree species in Great Britain (GB) on a 1Ã1 km 2 grid. Each 1Ã1 km 2 grid cell was assigned to one of 56 land classes on the basis of environmental and land cover attributes. The mean occurrence and cover ...Uses of TLS to sample shrubland environments throughout plots have included ranged (<50 m) sensing and biomass estimation of shrubs (Greaves et al., 2015), local estimations of shrub and herbaceous fuelbed volume (Loudermilk et al., 2009, Rowell et al., 2016), identification of individual shrubs across plots and measurement of height and crown area (Vierling et al., 2013), estimation of ...

Biomass at the plot level was indirectly measured by converting fresh weight to dry weight according to established relationships built from randomly selected samples . Specifically, all individual maize plants within each plot were first harvested and weighted fresh in the field using an electronic scale with an accuracy of 1 g ...For each plot in the study area, five squares of an area of 0.25 m 2 were randomly established (25 quadrats in total), where the herbaceous vegetation was cut at ground level. ...In general, foliage biomass is concentrated vertically in the central parts of the crown, increasing downward from the top of the tree to some maximum and then decreasing to the base of the crown ( Kantola and MÃ¤kelÃ¤, 2004, Schneider et al., 2011 ).The mean foliar biomass of individual branches (FB B) was 25% greater in spruce than pine (Table 3) despite the similarity in size of trees of both species, i.e., similar mean and range of branch diameters (D BR), total tree heights (H T), diameters at breast height (D BH), and crown lengths (CL B).Plot-level traits: scaling leaf-level to plot-level measurements. Each plot had a planted species richness of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16, with an average of 6 species per plot. Complete sampling of all species would require 54 spectral measurements to estimate plot-level traits for a single plot (54 = 6 species â 3 individuals â 3 canopy ...The results showed that waveform metrics have strong potential for estimating woody (R 2 = 0.71) and foliar biomass (R 2 = 0.73) at the tree-level in a savanna environment [37]. ... ...The variance of the plot-level biomass is the sum of the within- and between-strata variance: Var (M) = â i = 1 p Ï i Var (M i) + S p 2 where Var (M i) is the plot-level biomass variance within stratum i as defined in Section 2.2, and S p 2 is the between-strata variance of biomass: S p 2 = | A | 2 â i = 1 p Ï i [Î» i E (B i ...1.1.1. Definitions. Plant biomass (W) is the weight of living plant material contained above and below a unit of ground surface area at a given point in time. Production is the biomass or weight of organic matter assimilated by a community or species per unit land area per unit time.Comparisons between the measured and predicted fresh biomass (FM) at the plot level (N = 386) in the combined dataset from six prediction models: (A) M1: FM â¼ NDVI + Sonar _ PH + NDVI Ã Sonar _ PH, (B) M2: FM â¼ NDVI + LV _ PH + NDVI Ã LV _ PH, (C) M3: F M ~ L V Ã N D V I, (D) M4: F M ~ L V Ã L V _ D e n, (E) M5: F M ~ L V Ã ...Our results demonstrate that: (1) tree height and NM may independently control foliar structure and physiology, and have an even greater impact on biomass allocation; and (2) the modified withinâplant light availabilities alone do not explain the observed patterns.

Leaf dry matter content: Leaf dry-matter content (LDMC) is the oven-dry mass (mg) of a leaf, divided by its water-saturated fresh mass (g), expressed in mg g-1 Using these units, LWC is simply 1000-LDMC. LDMC is related to the average density (fresh mass per fresh volume) of the leaf tissues.Summary. â¢. This study compared the predictive ability of dry matter content (DMC, dry mass per fresh mass) of leaves, stems, roots and entire plants in relation to dry matter concentration (D, dry mass per volume of plant organ). Data came from 28 species of field-collected plants (woody and herbaceous) and 17 species of ...Leaf-colour modification is expected to improve dry matter accumulation either by extending the canopy duration (G traits) (Gregersen et al., 2013, Borrell et al., 2014) or by allowing more light penetrated into the lower canopy (Y traits) (Ort et al., 2011, Gu et al., 2017b).Linear regression relationships between measured leaf thickness (LT, Î¼m) and the inverse of the product of specific leaf area (SLA, m 2 kg â1) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC, mg g â1) for all studies (open circles) and for succulent-leaved species (filled circles with outliers, Crassula sp. and Euphorbia sp. indicated by ...Both for green leaves and litter, these traits represented (a) leaf structure, that is specific leaf area (SLA, fresh area per dry mass) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC, dry mass per saturated mass) and (b) leaf chemistry, including nitrogen concentration ([N]), phosphorus concentration ([P]), carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) and pH.PDF | This study compared the predictive ability of dry matter content (DMC, dry mass per fresh mass) of leaves, stems, roots and entire plants in... | Find, read and cite all the research you ...In vitro dry matter degradation For leaf blades, 1-cm sections of coastal bermuda grass were prepared for digestion studies in Hungate tubes as described (Akin and Rigsby, 1987 ). For stems, 1-cm sections of the fifth internode from the apex of bermuda grass plants were cut as described (Akin et al., 1989).Leaf dry matter content (LDMC) is widely used as an indicator of plant resource use in plant functional trait databases. Two main methods have been proposed to measure LDMC, which basically differ in the rehydration procedure to which leaves are subjected after harvesting.In order to convert the data to dry matter weight per square meter, the original data were multiplied by the expected number of plants per square meter under the four different treatments. The aboveground dry matter includes that of the leaf blades, leaf sheaths, stems, and ears.Leaves were considered as dead, when the leaf blade was either completely yellow or by at least 50% dry and dead. Leaf area of all green leaves was measured with a LI-COR leaf area meter (LI-3000C) in combination with a belt conveyer accessory (LI-3050C). All plant material was dried at 70 Â°C for at least 48 h and weighed.

Leaves are generally composed of a few main parts: the blade and the petiole. Figure 13.1.2 13.1. 2: A leaf is usually composed of a blade and a petiole. The blade is most frequently the flat, photosynthetic part. The petiole is a stem that attaches the leaf blade to the main stem of the plant.The flat structure of a leaf blade enables it to function as a photosynthetic organ for efficient light capture. The leaf rim or the edge-most region of leaf margin directs the planar...The second experiment, which investigated fresh and air-dried leaf-blades of 4.0 and 0.5 cm cut-lengths, fermentation of fresh leaf-blades produced results similar to those obtained in the first experiment. The 4.0 cm cut-lengths, relative to the 0.5 cm cut lengths, produced more (17.9%) gas and more (26.9%) fermentation end-products ...Each leaf typically has a leaf blade called the lamina, which is also the widest part of the leaf. Some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a petiole. Leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called sessile leaves. Leaves also have stipules, small green appendages usually found at the base of the ...Green leaves are fundamental for the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems (Wright et al., 2004) because green leaf blades are the principal organs of net primary productivity, gas exchange, and evapotranspiration.Leaf damage during and after harvest is affected by crop species. â¢ Small round lesions appear on leaf blade and edges. â¢ Post-harvest processing modifies leaf microbial community structure. â¢ Highly damaged leaves should be removed before packaging.(C): Differences in leaf blade margin of fresh leaf cross sections of A donax leaves: (a) green mature leaf, (b) senescent leaf. The walls are thick, and the cells are hyaline and without chlorophyll that distinguishes it from other epidermal cells.Plant fresh weight (A), leaf area (B), shoot dry weight (C), and whole-plant net assimilation (D) of lettuce plants as affected by the different proportions of green light. Different letters in each column indicate significant differences at p < 0.05, according to the least significant difference (LSD) test.Fresh leaf tissues were observed using the SEM equipped with the Coolstage, which maintained the tissues at temperatures below 0Â°C to avoid water evaporation (Nery et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2019). Samples observed at â15Â°C were used to represent the SEM Coolstage method to compare with other methods. Leaves were separated from ...Using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we introduced the use of Raman spectroscopy to measure shade-induced changes of metabolites in vivo. Raman spectroscopy detected a decrease in carotenoid contents in leaf blades and petioles of plants with SAS, which were induced by low Red:Far-red light ratio or high density conditions ...

The increase in the dry mass of green forage was due to the increases of both dry mass of green leaf blade (Figure 7) and dry mass of green stem (Figure 8). The latter...Total dry matter mass (TDM), potentially digestible dry matter (pDDM), dry pseudostem (DP), green pseudostem (GP), dry leaf blade (DLB) and green leaf blade (GLB) of Marandu...Leaf dry matter content: Leaf dry-matter content (LDMC) is the oven-dry mass (mg) of a leaf, divided by its water-saturated fresh mass (g), expressed in mg g-1 Using these units, LWC is simply 1000-LDMC. LDMC is related to the average density (fresh mass per fresh volume) of the leaf tissues.Leaf dry mass. Leaves (including blade, petiole, and stipules when present) were then dried for a minimum of 72 hours at 65 Â°C before dry mass was measured to the nearest 0.0001 g. 5.Leaf dry mass multiplied by the specific leaf area is converted into leaf area. Direct methods in evergreen species are necessarily destructive. However, they are widely used in crops and pastures by harvesting the vegetation and measuring leaf area within a certain ground surface area.Leaf mass per area (LMA) is a morphological trait widely used as a good indicator of plant functioning (i.e. photosynthetic and respiratory rates, chemical composition, resistance to herbivory, etc.).Summary. â¢. This study compared the predictive ability of dry matter content (DMC, dry mass per fresh mass) of leaves, stems, roots and entire plants in relation to dry matter concentration (D, dry mass per volume of plant organ). Data came from 28 species of field-collected plants (woody and herbaceous) and 17 species of ...Depending on the size of the individual leaves, LT was measured on five to ten points per leaf (blade), avoiding the mid-vein. Leaves were then oven-dried at 60 Â°C for at least 2 d, and their dry mass was determined. From these measurements, mean values of LDMC, SLA and LT were calculated.

However, independently from moisture content, maize straw can be a good (for more wet material) or very good (for more dried straw) substrate for the biogas plant.Statement of Novelty. Cereal straw is an abundant agricultural by-product in Europe. This study provides new knowledge on straw availability and the potential impact of large-scale straw removal on organic matter in agricultural soils in a regional investigation in Sweden.5.2 Crop production. The interaction of straw biochar and fertilizer is advocated as a good approach for improving soil qualities, thereby increasing crop biomass accumulation and crop productivity. In addition, the application of straw biochar alone may not increase crop productivity and may reduce crop yields.Straw Biomass. It is evident that straw biomass is an abundant and inexpensive lignocellulosic resource for manufacturing eco-building materials.

It has been employed extensively in both research and agricultural applications, with a range of different plant species.

We compared biomass estimates for individual trees, plots, and at the landscape-scale using our locally-developed allometric equations, nationwide equations applied across the U.S., and the Forest Inventory and Analysis Component Ratio Method (FIA-CRM).Building on a LiDAR biomass index (LBI) developed for use with terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data, we successfully developed an improved and robust LBI-based approach to estimate forest AGB at both individual tree and plot levels while minimizing the effort required for field data collection. This approach was tested for larch ...Direct measurement of the AGB of a tree requires that the tree be harvested and weighed to determine the total dry biomass of all its aboveground components.It was undertaken over the same site as the AfriSAR campaign from December 2017 to January 2018. A total of 27 plots were randomly sampled. Each measured 30.8 Ã 30.8 m, the size of which differed from those of the AfriSAR campaign (1-ha). Within each plot, the total number of trees (Na) were counted.

Within the forested area, increases in AGB (carbon) occur through growth, with rates of uptake greater for forests in the early stages of regeneration but ...

1. Introduction Biomass is an important measure of ecosystem productivity and is highly related to ecosystem structure and function ( Lohbeck et al., 2015 ). About 90% of the total aboveground biomass (AGB) of the terrestrial ecosystem is stored within forests ( Dixon et al., 1994; Guo et al., 2010 ).On a plot-level (a fixed size of 32 m Ã 32 m), approximately 97%, 93%, and 75% of individual trees could be recorded in easy (ca. 700 stems/ha), medium (ca. 900 stems/ha), and difficult stands (ca. 2, 200 stems/ha), respectively, using five-scan ), promising digitization can be expected for 87%, 69%, and 55% of individual trees in easy, medium a...The total biomass of 153 trees in the plantation plot was overestimated by 17.12 %, and the total biomass of 61 trees in the mingled forest plot was underestimated by 10.88 %. This method has the potential to be applied to a larger area, even if the requirements for memory and calculation time may increase with the increase of the ...Total aboveground biomass (kg/ha) Note: If harvesting all biomass in the harvest area is not possible, there is an alternative method of sampling a representative number of stems (e.g. 50 stems) to determine harvest index and estimate biomass from grain yield and harvest index.Total fresh grain weight (g) Ã Dry weight of grain subsample (g)] Ã 10,000 (5) Fresh weight of grain (g) Net harvest area (m2) 1000 Dry weight of chaff (kg/ha) = Dry weight of chaff (g) Ã 10,000 (6) 1000 Net harvest area (m2) Step 2: alculation of dry weight of biomass Dry weight of biomass (kg/ha) = [Total fresh biomass weight (g) Ãwhere, B = Total tree biomass (kg), Bs = Stem biomass (kg), Bb = Branch biomass (kg), and Bf = Foliage biomass (kg) Forest soil organic carbon (SOC) Forest soil samplingStep 3: alculation of total aboveground biomass (oven-dried weight) and harvest index Total aboveground biomass (kg/ha) = Dry weight of grains (kg/ha) + Dry weight of straw (kg/ha) (7) Harvest index = Dry weight of grains (kg/ha) (8) Total aboveground biomass (kg/ha) ontributorThe results showed that terrestrial lidar data were useful for estimating maize biomass at all levels (at each level, R 2 was greater than 0.80), and biomass estimation at leaf group level was the most precise (R 2 = 0.97, RMSE = 2.22 g) among all four levels. All four regression techniques performed similarly at all levels.that biomass is uniformly distributed within the canopy projection, which is simple but not realistic. It was not until Kleinn et al.

The weight remaining is the dry matter (dm) of the sample. In this method, the temperature is sufficiently low enough for the sugars not to burn. When the sample contains a small amount of sugar (<4-5%), the 'normal' drying method can be used: a fixed amount of sample is dried in a drying oven at 103Â°C to a constant weight (> 4 hours).Dry matter is measured in the laboratory. A weighed sample of the substance mixture (sometimes called fresh mass) is taken and heated to over 100Â°C in the drying room in order to evaporate the residual moisture (mostly water). The remaining dry residue is weighed and proportioned.Dry matter refers to material remaining after removal of water, and the moisture content reflects the amount of water present in the feed ingredient. The nutrients in feeds, required by the animal for maintenance, growth, pregnancy, and lactation, are part of the DM portion of the feed.Dry matter (DM) is defined as the remaining proportion of the sample after drying to constant weight at a defined temperature and after compensation for loss of volatile compounds in certain feeds (e.g. silage).Dry Matter or Total Solids refers to the percentage of material remaining after removal of water. The animal feed, pet food, and forage industry uses the term âdry matter.â The human food, water, manure and compost industry uses the term âtotal solids.âThe dry matter or dry weight is a measure of the mass of a completely dried substance. Analysis of food The dry matter of plant and animal material consists of all its constituents excluding water. The dry matter of food includes carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants (e.g., thiocyanate, anthocyanin, and quercetin ).Objectives of this study were 1) to compare fixed-time hand rinsing to fixed-time machine rinsing, 2) to evaluate effects of length of machine rinsing, and 3) to evaluate effects of numbers of bags simultaneously rinsed on DM remaining, DM disappearance, and their SE.The remaining dry matter consists of carbon (C), oxygen, hydrogen (H) and small amounts of sulphur (S), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg). Although present in small amounts, these nutrients are very important from the viewpoint of soil fertility management.Dry matter accumulation (DMA) and dry matter partitioning (DMP) are important physiological processes determining crop yield formation (Kumar et al., 2006). In agro-ecosystems, crop yield is not only dependent on DMA, but also closely related to efficient allocation of dry matter to harvested organs ( Zhang et al., 2019 ).Most of the remaining dry matter (i.e., 10â20% w/w) is composed of soluble sugars (e.g., fructose, glucose, sucrose, sorbitol) and more complex soluble and insoluble polysaccharides such as ...

operation (September 28, 2020). The cotton stalk moisture content was maintained in its natural state from its time in the field. The average value of the cotton stalk moisture content was 66.4%. Tests were carried out immediately after the samples were taken, and all of the mechanical measurements were performed in a laboratory setting usingIn this paper, the friction characteristics of cotton stalks were studied using response surface methodology, and the influence of the variation in contact materials, sampling location, and moisture content on the static sliding friction coefficient (ms) and stable static rolling angle (js) were analyzed.(moisture content, particle size, bulk density and porosity) of corn cobs, leaves and stalks were determined in this study. The moisture contents were 6.38, 7.92 and 6.40% of the cobs, leaves and stalks, respectively. The cobs had the highest weight percentage (18.23%) of the small particles (<0.212 mm) and the leaves hadChopped cotton stalks having a moisture content varying from 8.5% to 21.45% (w.b.) were densified into square blocks (80 mm by 80 mm) at compression pressures ranging between 13.79 and 34.47 MPa and a dwell time of 1 min, using a vertical compaction machine. Physical characteristics of blocks, namely bulk density, compression ratio ...In this study, a hyperspectral imaging system has been developed to evaluate and visualize the Brix values and moisture contents in sugarcane stalks to be used as a tool for breeding programmes. After extracting the spectral data via ENVI coding, data in the wavelength range of 450â950 nm were used to generate prediction models for ...The moisture content of the fresh cotton stalks was 46.13% to 69.8% wet basis. During the field sampling performed on 8 October, 2021, cotton plants with few branches, no damage, good straightness, and small variation in main stem diameter were selected as test samples.Stalks with mean moisture content of 70.05 Â± 2.42%, 48.12 Â± 1.19%, 28.14. Â±2.02% and 18.14 Â± 2.22% were subjected to cutting using three ground speeds (2.5 kmh â1, 5.0 kmh â1 and 7.5 kmh â1) and three machine speeds (30Â°, 45Â° and 60Â°), and the cutting propertiesâlength of cut (LC) and length remaining in the soil (LS)âwere measured with tape mea...It was concluded that an increase in moisture content of stem leads to a decrease in the tensile strength, bending stress, Young's modulus, torsional stress, modulus of rigidity and to an increase in shear strength and shearing energy.It was observed that the maximum cutting energy of 583.37 kJ were observed for 26 mm stalk girth with 10 Â±5 % (w.b) moisture content and minimum cutting energy of 72.32 kJ was observed at 30 Â± 5 % (w.b) moisture content (w.b) for 14 mm stalk girth.Particle size and moisture content also affected the SV of fungi. The highest SV 2.55 after 20 days of pretreatment was observed in 5 mm cotton stalk particles at 75% moisture content (Table 1). The SV decreased to 2.15, when particle size of cotton stalks decreased to 1 mm with 75% moisture content, due to the high cellulose loss ...

Crop yield is a standard measurement of the amount of agricultural production harvestedâyield of a cropâper unit of land area. Crop yield is the measure most often used for cereal,...Crop yields are the harvested production per unit of harvested area for crop products. In most of the cases yield data are not recorded, but are obtained by dividing the production data by the data on area harvested.The order of operations can vary but this procedure calculates yields via the follow steps: 1) adjust harvested grain moisture to standard moisture, 2) convert harvested area to acres, 3) calculate pounds per acre, 4) calculate bu ac-1 (or convert to SI units). Yields need to be calculated independently for every experimental unit (e.g., plot).Cereal yield vs. fertilizer use; Cereal yields; Change in cereal production, yield, land use and population; Crop yields; How much cropland has the world spared due to increases in crop yields? Almond yields; Area of land needed to meet global vegetable oil demand; Area of land needed to produce one tonne of vegetable oil; Banana yields; Barley ...In this method, yield in one or more subplots is measured and total yield per unit area is calculated as total production divided by total harvested area in the crop cut plot or subplot. The number of sub-plots and area of each sub-plot to be selected for yield estimation through crop cuts depends on the resources availability and level of ...the crop was produced. The estimation of yield can be calculated using kernel weight at harvest, plot area harvested, plant density, and moisture content of grain at harvest. For instance, to get the full expression of maize yield potential, the plants must be at optimum density. In some circumstances,Crop yields in alley cropping decreased on average with 2.6% per year over the first 21 years of the tree stand, indicating increasing competitive effects of the trees with their age.Under the higher yield levels (>15 Mg/ha), the average grain yield, DM, and HI were 16.91 Mg/ha (range: 15.03â20.70 Mg/ha), 30.71 Mg/ha (range: 22.06â38.83 Mg/ha), and 0.54 (range: 0.43â0.64), respectively; under the lower yield levels (<15 Mg/ha), the average grain yield, DM, and HI were 10.15 Mg/ha (range: 3.43â14.99 Mg/ha), 22.35 Mg ...Crop yield (production per unit harvested area) is an essential variable in many disciplines. Global yield datasets for the historical past have increasingly been used to analyze...Grain yield (kg/ha) = [(sample Yield per plot (kg) x 10,000)] / [(number sub-samples x segment length (metres) x row spacing (metres)] For example, if 2 kilograms are harvested from 20 measured segments in a plot, each segment is 2 metres long, and average row spacing is 0.75 metres then:

the leaching of dissolved organic matter contained in standing dead leaves (Angst et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2017). Due to the low temperature in winter, micro-bial activity is expected to be limited. Both micro-bial activity and abiotic processes can inuence the decomposition of standing dead leaves. It is currentlyHere, the authors turn dead leaves into an active material which acts as bioplastic and shows high performance in solar water evaporation, photocatalytic H2 production and antibiotic...Leaf dry matter content, also known as the leaf mass per area (LMA), is an indicator of vegetation growing condition. It is defined as the ratio of leaf dry mass to leaf area (unit, g / c m 2 ), and is widely used a key parameter for studies of terrestrial ecosystem monitoring ( Schimel et al., 2015 ), species identification ...Plant litter (also leaf litter, tree litter, soil litter, litterfall or duff) is dead plant material (such as leaves, bark, needles, twigs, and cladodes) that have fallen to the ground. This detritus or dead organic material and its constituent nutrients are added to the top layer of soil, commonly known as the litter layer or O ...In this study, with the increase of dust deposition on leaves, the dry matter content and tissue density of leaves increased significantly. This shows that plants use more resources for the construction of defense structures in order to reduce the damage degree of leaves.Understanding the rate at which leaves decay can help scientists predict this global flux of carbon dioxide, and develop better models for climate change. But this is a thorny problem: A single leaf may undergo different rates of decay depending on a number of variables: local climate, soil, microbes and a leafâs composition.In terrestrial ecosystems, fungi and bacteria that enter soils with dead leaves often play prominent roles in decomposition, but their role in aquatic decomposition is less known. Here, we test ...Based on the very limited empirical data available, we hypothesized that variation in species traits including leaf (litter) pH, within and between ecosystems contrasting in soil pH, would have stronger effects on leaf litter decomposition rates than variation in soil chemistry would.Leaf dry matter content (LDMC) is widely used as an indicator of plant resource use in plant functional trait databases. Two main methods have been proposed to measure LDMC, which basically differ in the rehydration procedure to which leaves are subjected after harvesting.Total dry matter yield in sweet sorghum is positively correlated with total leaf area, leaf area index (LAI), at anthesis (Ferraris, 1981). LAI also appeared to have a direct influence on Brix ( Choudhari et al., 1987 ).

This briefing presents the information on soil carbon that can be extracted from the 2021 national greenhouse gas inventories, as reported by EU Member States for the year 2019. It also gives an overview on the status of soil carbon pools across Europe.Integrated to a depth of 1 m, global soil carbon has a mean age of 4,830 Â± 1,730 yr, with older carbon in deeper layers and permafrost regions. In contrast, vertically resolved land models ...Soil carbon (C) plays a key role in mitigating and adapting to global climate change. In-situ soil C measurement has faced many challenges including those related to aerial coverage, economics, accuracy, and availability.In this study, we take advantage of a global data set of SOC measurements in 113,013 soil profiles across the globe 29 which includes 2,703 soil profiles in the northern hemisphere permafrost ...Abstract. Sustainable soil carbon sequestration practices need to be rapidly scaled up and implemented to contribute to climate change mitigation. We highlight that the major potential for carbon ...That paper concluded by presenting a future vision for a global framework to assess soil carbon change, based on a combination of mathematical models, spatial data to drive the models, short- and long-term data to evaluate the models, and a network of benchmarking sites to verify estimated changes.How to measure, report and verify soil carbon change to realize the potential of soil carbon sequestration for atmospheric greenhouse gas removal. Glob. Chang Biol. 26 , 219â241 (2020).Abstract. This review covers the current and emerging analytical methods used in laboratory, field, landscape and regional contexts for measuring soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in agricultural soil. Soil depth plays an important role in estimating SOC sequestration.This chapter explores those issues and discusses various SOC measurement methods. Soil organic carbon is an extremely important soil health indicator because it influences almost all soil biological, chemical, and physical properties and processes. Development of conservation agriculture practices has increased SOC.

Ground cover was estimated from LiDAR using two methodologies: red reflectance image and canopy height. In contrast to NDVI, LiDAR was not affected by saturation at high ground cover, and the comparison of both LiDAR methodologies showed strong association (r2 = 0.92 and slope = 1.02) at ground cover above 0.8. For above-ground ...Leaf area index is the one-sided, green leaf area of a canopy or plant community per unit ground area. To directly measure LAI, you would have to measure the area of each leaf in the canopy above a unit of ground area. Because this method is both destructive and incredibly time consuming, it is rarely used. All other measurements ofmean NAR, instantaneous NAR can be estimated by calculating rate of dry matter accumulation at time t (i.e., by differentiating the "growth curve" at time = t) and measuring LAI at time = t.

The crop thus reaches its full production potential under the given environment. The crop water need mainly depends on:In the crop coefficient approach the crop evapotranspiration, ET c, is calculated by multiplying the reference crop evapotranspiration, ET o, by a crop coefficient, K c : ET c = K c ET o (56) where ET c crop evapotranspiration [mm d -1 ], K c crop coefficient [dimensionless], ET o reference crop evapotranspiration [mm d -1 ].The average estimation accuracy of percentage ground cover from WDVI was of the same magnitude as that of the conventional methods, i.e. about 5 per cent (absolute value) for potato and beet for the whole growing season, and about 5 per cent at low ground cover to 10-12 per cent at high ground cover for the cereals in the vegetative ...K cb full can be adjusted for tree crops by multiplying by a reduction factor (F r) estimated using a mean leaf stomatal resistance term.

Greater recovery of roots and more predictable recovery of the active microbial biomass across the high diversity management strategy chronosequence corresponded with faster recovery of soil structure.The average resistance and recovery rate of evergreen and deciduous forests during moderate droughts exhibited high spatial variability in Chinaâs forest ecosystems ( Fig. 3 a, b). Highly resistant forests had a low recovery rate, whereas forests with low resistance had a high recovery rate.We identified trees, shrubs and vines â¥2.5 cm DBH in a chronosequence comprising 33 sites, aged 3â60 yr since the formation of closed canopy (9â69 yr since pasture abandonment) and compared them with eight sites in nearby mature forest remnants.We also found that soil water content around dominant slow-growing species was 1.5â3 times greater than for fast-growing species in both seasons. Therefore, reforestation based on monoculture plantings of fast-growing species seems difficult to effectively recover the soil water content.The LD indices (e.g., LD 50), reflecting plant dehydration tolerance, varied with all the tested factors, revealing that plant survival and post-drought recovery depend on VPD levels and plantâplant interactions for a given plant species and population.Assessments of the restoration performance over different ecosystems worldwide show that, when traditional restoration guidelines based on the recovery of those simple metrics are followed; (1)...The present article reviews available literature on the recovery process examined in various plant species, in response to several metals (Al, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn), applied at different concentrations and treatment duration. The reviewed studies have been carried out in laboratory conditions.It follows that assessment of plant recovery, as is commonly performed after a given number of days of dehydration, may identify survival mainly by way of dehydration avoidance, while the resolution of dehydration tolerance requires normalized RWC at the point of recovery.Moreover, there are various examples from other species including algae, plants, insects, marine invertebrates and humans where the proportion surviving to maximum age is also equal or close...

This theory, narrowed down to sugar nutrients, states that a minimal level of sugar assimilates needs to reach the apex (flowering) or lateral bud (removal of apical dominance) before floral transition or lateral bud outgrowth is initiated.This paper shows data of sugarcane stem height on plots selected by reflectance sensor during two growing seasons compared to biomass accumulation and N-uptake on commercial sugarcane fields ...grower will be discussed. Reference is made to the botany of the cane stem, cane leaves and root system.

Canopy height 1. Introduction The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is the first spaceborne lidar mission optimized for high-resolution ecosystem structure measurements within the coverage of International Space Station (ISS).A new, 30-m spatial resolution global forest canopy height map was developed through the integration of the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation ( GEDI) lidar forest structure measurements and Landsat analysis-ready data time-series.3) Canopy height showed high heritability from all datasets, and 3D sensing datasets had even higher heritability (H2 = 0.79â0.89) than FM (field measurement) (H2 = 0.77). Finally, outliers of different datasets are analyzed. The results provide novel insights into different methods for canopy height measurement that may ensure the ...Canopy Height Model (CHM): the height or residual distance between the ground and the top of the of objects above the ground. This includes the actual heights of trees, builds and any other objects on the earthâs surface. This CHM is created by subtracting the DTM from the DSM.Canopy height serves as a good indicator of forest carbon content. Remote sensing-based direct estimations of canopy height are usually based on Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometric data.We selected four pine stands to assess the effect of horizontal resolution on lidar-based canopy height measurement. The case studies represented stands with: (1) dense, homogeneous canopy cover; (2) small gaps; (3) narrow, linear gaps between planted rows; and (4) large, irregularly shaped gaps.Here we present a comprehensive global canopy height map at 10 m ground sampling distance for the year 2020. We have developed a probabilistic deep learning model that fuses sparse height...Methods for measuring the height of trees mainly include traditional measurements and remote sensing inversions. Traditional canopy height measurement relies on the manual use of optical measuring instruments (e.g., altimeters or laser range finders) to calculate the height of trees.

I am not quite sure if it is possible to use the formula: RGR (H)= (H2-H1)/H/ (t2-t1) where H is the mean of plant height during the period (t2-t1), which is modified from plant relative...Plant growth rate can be measured as the relative increase in leaf area over time, by substituting total plant leaf area for total biomass in the conventional RGR equation. RGR A = (ln LA 2 âln LA 1) / ( t 2 â t 1) (6.14)Modelling individual plant growth. The strategy of modelling individual plant growth is straightforward: 1) A suitable function of relative growth rate is selected from Table 1 or from other publications. 2) A primary plant size characteristic is identified, e.g. tree volume.In the case of two harvests, RGR can be simply calculated as [3] [4] In the case of more harvests, a linear equation can be fitted through the ln-transformed size data. The slope of this line gives an estimate of the average RGR for the period under investigation, with units of g.g â1 .day â1.We demonstrate a variety of nonlinear models that are appropriate for modelling plant growth and, for each, show how to calculate function-derived growth rates, which allow unbiased comparisons among species at a common time or size. We show how to propagate uncertainty in estimated parameters to express uncertainty in growth rates ...time that passed between the two height measurements. For example, if you measured a plant that was 3 cm tall on Day 4 and 10 cm tall on Day 6, you would have: Growth Rate = (10 cm â 3 cm)/(6 days â 4 days) = 7 cm/2 days = 3.5 cm/day. The unit of time here is days. For any type of rate equation, a change in time will always be used.

Around 68% of heights will fall within one standard deviation of the mean height; 95% within two standard deviations; and 99.7% within three. If we know the mean and standard deviation of heights, we have a good understanding of how heights vary across a population.Here, standard deviation is a measure of how spread out human height is. A larger standard deviation means a greater variation in height. The standard deviation automatically set in the height percentile calculator is approximated from Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization data [1,2,3]. Specific countries will vary somewhat ...I am looking at the following: The average tallest men live in Netherlands and Montenegro mit 1.83 m= 183 cm. The average shortest men live in Indonesia mit 1.58 m= 158 cm. The standard deviation of the height in Netherlands/Montenegro is 9.7 cm and in Indonesia it is 7.8 cm.Health care professionals sometimes convert height, weight or body mass index (BMI) measurements to standard deviation scores (SDS). The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or spread of a set of values around the mean or average (also called the expected value).In a normal curve, there is a specific relationship between its âheightâ and its âwidth.â Normal curves can be tall and skinny or they can be short and fat. They are all symmetric, unimodal, and centered at \(\mu\), the population mean.Standard deviation (SD) for height by age (WHO 2006 growth standard) Source publication +1 Using height-for-age differences (HAD) instead of height-for-age z-scores (HAZ) for the...This means that most men (about 68%, assuming a normal distribution) have a height within 3 inches of the mean ( 67â73 inches ) â one standard deviation â and almost all men (about 95%) have a height within 6 inches of the mean ( 64â76 inches ) â two standard deviations.The standard normal distribution, also called the z-distribution, is a special normal distribution where the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. Every normal distribution is a version of the standard normal distribution thatâs been stretched or squeezed and moved horizontally right or left.Published on September 17, 2020 by Pritha Bhandari . Revised on June 21, 2023. The standard deviation is the average amount of variability in your dataset. It tells you, on average, how far each value lies from the mean.Regarding the change in the height SDS from birth to 3 years of age, 33.4% of children increased more than 0.5 SDs, 39.8% of children decreased more than 0.5 SDs, and 34.4% of children remained within Â±0.5 SDs. The change in height SDS displayed a strong positive correlation with the change in weight during the four periods.

TVD schemes develop formulae for interpolation of a cell-face value of the transported variable. If the interpolated value is bounded by the neighbouring nodal values then the scheme is âBoundedâ. However, not all TVD schemes possess this property of âBoundednessâ.this paper we propose some natural limitations on the interpolated values between two mesh points and we establish in the third part su cient conditions that prove that the resulting scheme is TVD.However, even second-order discretisation schemes, which at first appear to be inherently interpolative bounded, such as central differencing via linear interpolation to faces, can produce an oscillatory solution in regions of steep property gradient.Higher-order TVD interpolation in multi-dimension is developed. The major advantage of MHTVD (Multi-dimensional Higher-order TVD) is the com-plete multi-dimensional monotonic characteristics and it is possible to be more than 3rd order spatial accuracy. In addition, MHTVD shows good con-vergence characteristics and is computationally eï¬cient ...The TVDal scheme has also been applied to model tidally induced internal lee waves, indicating that TVDal has the potential ability to balance the numerical compression and diffusion of conventional TVD schemes for cases with highly nonlinear, stratified, and nonhomogeneous flow fields.A numerical scheme is presented for accurate simulation of fluid flow using the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) on unstructured mesh. A finite volume approach is adopted to discretize the LBE on a cell-centered, arbitrary shaped, triangular tessellation.Taking advantage of FUNWAVE-TVD model's capacity to employ rapidly varying terrains and steep slopes in the surf zone, this study provides significant insights into the sediment transport dynamics in a variety of coastal engineering applications.This article discusses adjusting inverse distance interpolation for use in unstructured mesh finite volume solutions.

Show that this TVDâIMM algorithm gives a very good results even at high Rayleigh numbers.The interpolated primitive variables on cell boundaries are determined by using the third-order MUSCL method. The solution of the fluid flow is advanced in time by using the second-order TVD RungeâKutta scheme. The proposed coupling method updates the burning surface and grid classification once when the movement distance is ...

Because wells are not always drilled vertically, there may be two "depths" for every given point in a wellbore: the measured depth (MD) measured along the path of the borehole, and the true vertical depth (TVD), the vertical distance between the datum and the point of interest.Typically, the maximum inclination is reduced to zero at Dt with drop radius R1, derived in the same manner as the build radius, R. KBTVD BG: Distance from the surface location to the KOP; KBTVD AG: True vertical Depth of well (KBTVD); B-D: Distance from KOP to the bottom of the hole (MD);INFLUX HEIGHT FRACTURE MUD WEIGHT/GRADIENT/PRESSURE FORMULAS GAS KICK ASSOCIATED FORMULAS DRILLING MUD-ASSOCIATED CALCULATIONS IN WELL CONTROL WELL CONTROL EQUIPMENT RELATED FORMULAS HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE (all depths TVD): Constants: PPG x FT x .052 = PSI, SG x FT x .433 = PSI, SG x MT x 1.42 = PSI, PPG x MT x .171 = PSI, SG x MT x .098 = BARS,1. n.

This is one of two primary depth measurements used by the drillers, the other being measured depth.Total variation diminishing. In numerical methods, total variation diminishing (TVD) is a property of certain discretization schemes used to solve hyperbolic partial differential equations. The most notable application of this method is in computational fluid dynamics. The concept of TVD was introduced by Ami Harten.Where: MAASP = Maximum allowable annular surface pressure (psi) MW = Mud weight in hole (SG) Pleak = Leak-off pressure at the open hole weak point (psi) SF = Safety factor (psi) TVDwp = Vertical depth at the open hole weak point (m) Or the TVD in feet and the coefficient is 0.433.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2023.116070.

Our study focuses on street trees that fork between 30 and 137 cm of height (hereafter âmulti-stemmed treesâ), which researchers have identified as particularly challenging in the ongoing development of urban allometric models, as well as consistency in measurements across space and time.Mikita et al. (2016) estimated d.b.h. and stem volume of 118 trees (mean d.b.h. = 38.16 cm) in a 0.8 ha forest stand, with tree density of 30 per cent of our plot. D.b.h. estimates used a circle-fitting method and stem volumes were calculated by an allometric equation.The SED of the 1.581 Ã 10 6 logs varied from 3 to 80 cm, where values larger than 60 cm were found only in 0.3% of the logs. The individual log length ranged from 2.2 to 26.4 m, but lengths longer than 6.4 and 12 m represented less than 0.50% and less than 0.01% of the logs, respectively (Fig. 3 ).Based on the measured tree heights and the counted number of stems in each quadrant, the dominant height of each plot was computed to conform to this definition. A total of 841 tree heights were measured on the 39 plots. The mean dominant height of the 39 plots ranged from 1.76 to 6.01 m with an average of 3.80 mTable S1.

In this article, an analytical model for predicting the Mach stem height is improved based on two main assumptions: one is the calculation of the triple point deflection angle when the Mach stem is an oblique shock and the other is about the shape of the free part of the slip line.27 March 2021 | Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering, Vol. 236, No. 1Abstract A new, more accurate prediction of Mach stem height in steady flow is presented. In addition, starting with a regular reflection in the dual-solution domain, the growth rate of the Mach...The Mach stem height is an important parameter in the Mach reflection of steady supersonic flow. Various experimental, numerical, and theoretical works have been conducted to study this parameter in the past. However, much of the established work focuses around a single set of trailing edge heights.Abstract The flow from a supersonic nozzle when operated at off-design conditions exhibits a wide variety of complex flow structures. The prominent ones are the shock reflections inside the jet. The two main types of shock interactions are the regular reflection (RR) and Mach reflection (MR).The Mach stem heights are decided solely for the incoming flow Mach numbers and the wedge angles by the improved analytical model. As a result, the Mach stem heights by the model of this article ...After the completion of data screening and filtering, there were 0.448 Ã 10 6 stems and 1.581 Ã 10 6 logs remaining in the final data set.

Biomethane is obtained by upgrading biogas produced by transforming biomass such as agricultural residues, biowaste or forest wood through anaerobic digestion or pyrogasification processes. This raises the question ofBiochemical methane potential prediction of plant biomasses: Comparing chemical composition versus near infrared methods and linear versus non-linear models - ScienceDirect Bioresource Technology Volume 175, January 2015, Pages 382-390In this investigation, optical (SPOT-7 NAOMI), airborne LiDAR, and PolInSAR L-band data, along with forest inventories, were employed to develop models for estimating total dry aboveground biomass (AGB) over the tropical forests in the Congo Basin (Gabon) of Central Africa.Technological advancements employed for the bio-adsorption of CO 2 and H 2 S such as scrubbing, swing adsorption, and cryogenic separation from biogas are articulated. â¢ Modelling aspects for the adsorption of biogas for the enrichment of biomethane are discussed. â¢Each substrate was analysed in terms of dry matter (TS), volatile solids (TVS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total phosphorus (TP) according to the Standard Methods [25]. In particular TKN and TP have been processed through a high-performance Ethos-One microwave digestion system by Milestone (Italy ...Biomethane (also known as ârenewable natural gasâ) is a near-pure source of methane produced either by âupgradingâ biogas (a process that removes any CO 2 and other contaminants present in the biogas) or through the gasification of solid biomass followed by methanation:Biomethane potentials ranged from 384 to 315 and from 412 to 283 NL CH 4 kg VS â1 (normal liters of methane per kg of volatile solids) for leaves and stems, respectively. About digestion kinetics, maximum daily production rate ( R max) was significantly affected by harvest time and not by plant partitioning.The biomethane yields per hectare of giant reed (m 3 CH 4 ha â1) was calculated as the product of biomethane potential and dry biomass yield expressed in volatile solid (gVS ha â1).Biomethane is a near-pure source of methane produced either by âupgradingâ biogas or through the gasification of solid biomass; since it is indistinguishable from the regular natural gas stream, it can be transported and used wherever gas is consumed, but without adding to emissions.Aboveground biomass and biomethane potential were taken into account to evaluate methane yield per area unit. The area-specific methane yields had a mean of 119 L N CH 4 m â2 and a large range which was solely due to the variations in aboveground biomass (P < 0.001, Î·Â² = 97%) and not due to biomethane potentials (P = 0.600, Î·Â² ...

Agronomic and industrial characteristics related to the aboveground biomass (fresh and dry), chemical (sucrose, fiber, Brix, total recoverable sugar, extractives, ashes, lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose), and nutritional (macro- and micronutrients) composition were evaluated. Some energy cane genotypes presented higher dry biomass yield ...Above-ground biomass (AGB) is the total mass of material stored in the living stems, branches and leaves of vegetation, and is often described as a biomass density, with units of mass per unit area.The aboveground dry biomass yields of sugarcane and energy cane were 37.4 and 45.2 Mg ha â1, respectively, averaged across the two sites and three crops. The increased dry biomass yield for energy cane relative to sugarcane was mainly associated with stalk population (Zhao et al. 2017 ).Significant differences in growth and aboveground biomass were found in the monoculture wetlands. Species that showed faster growth and larger biomass in monoculture wetland were also dominant in the mixed wetland. The mixed wetland exhibited similar biomass and root growth to the averages of five monocultures.Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB), or carbon (AGC), in tropical forests has become a major concern for scientists and stakeholders. However, AGB assessment procedures are not fully standardized and even more importantly, the uncertainty associated with AGB estimates is seldom assessed.Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery (2023) Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) plays an important role in the study of the carbon cycle and climate change in the global terrestrial ecosystem. AGB ...Abstract. Crop traits such as aboveground biomass (AGB), total leaf area (TLA), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), and thousand kernel weight (TWK) are important indices in maize breeding. How to extract multiple crop traits at the same time is helpful to improve the efficiency of breeding.The fraction of plant biomass in aboveground versus root tissues has implications for carbon storage and dynamics. Here the authors collate a dataset on root-mass fractions and use these data to ...The living biomass of the worldâs forests contains more than 40% of the global terrestrial carbon (C) stocks [ 1 ]. Globally, belowground biomass (BGB) is estimated to account for 20â26% of the total biomass, and as such it is an important C pool for many vegetation types and land-use systems.Results showed that aboveground biomass, belowground biomass and total biomass all increased with increasing growing season precipitation, as expected in this water-limited ecosystem. Biomass allocation patterns also changed along the precipitation gradient, but significant variation between species was apparent.

Most pet foods can be divided into three categories based on moisture content: dry, semi-wet or soft-moist, and canned ( Kvamme and Phillips, 2003 ).Abstract. The digestion of starch-based foods in the small intestine as well as factors affecting their digestibility have been previously investigated and reviewed in detail. Starch digestibility has been studied both in vivo and in vitro, with increasing interest in the use of in vitro models.Chapter First Online: 10 October 2019 708 Accesses Abstract Structure is a fundamental factor in determining the way that digestible and non-digestible food carbohydrates (mono- and di-saccharides, oligo-saccharides and polysaccharides) influence a range of health outcomes.Driven by the immense functional and nutritional implications of starchâlipid binary interactions, this study is aimed at designing starch digestibility by controlling the interaction between starch and glycerol monostearate (GMS)/stearic acid (SA) using a hot-extrusion 3D printing (HE-3DP) environment.The starch digestibility has been shown to increase by 35â40% during cooking, autoclaving and puffing followed by pressure cooking and germination. They also reported that baking, frying and shallow frying reduced rapidly digestible starch (RDS) while roasting and pressure cooking enhanced the RDS to about 23% followed by cooking ...The in vitro starch digestion rate and estimated glycemic index (GI) of cereal starches were evaluated along with the impact of cooking on starch digestion. The cooking of starch slurries increased the rapidly digestible starch content from a range of 34.7â54.4% to a range of 60.5â78.5%.The first mathematical models to describe food digestibility have primarily focused on the wet mass retention ratio of the studied food (wet sample weight after digestion time, t, divided by the initial wet sample weight).The wet mass retention ratio has been observed to follow three distinct profiles (delayed sigmoidal, sigmoidal, and exponential; Figure 9.2), yet all three profiles can be ...

Cell wall residues in fibers are present throughout degraded regions of the cell wall under attacking by erosion bacteria. In the heavily degraded WAB (D), all the cell walls, even in the middle lamella, were depleted in the final stage of degradation. The corner middle lamella was the last structure to be attacked by bacteria (D ...Despite the utility of soybean cellulosic biomass and post-processing residues in biofuel generation, there is no comprehensive information available on cell wall loosening and degradation related ...Yeast cell wall (YCW) is a very rich waste from the yeast extract industry. Due to this, the aim of this work is to develop new biodegradable films based on residual YCW and the study of the effect of plasticization on films properties. Residual YCW was used as base matrix and different concentrations of glycerol (0, 15, 25 and 35 wt ...Trafficking-defective rabA mutants have already been shown to impact cell wall composition. To study the impacts of these mutants on cell wall digestion, we developed a saccharification process for Arabidopsis based on the hot water method.Cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) are a heterogeneous group of enzymes including glycosyl-hydrolases, oxidoreductases, lyases and esterases. Microbes with degrading activities towards plant cell wall polysaccharides are the most relevant source of CWDEs for industrial applications.The cell wall consists mainly of peptidoglycan (PG), a mesh of polysaccharide strands (composed of a poly-[N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc)] backbone) crosslinked via short peptide bridges attached to the MurNAc residues [7]. PG is synthesized on the external face of the cytoplasm. Synthesis steps include ...In this review, we highlight studies supporting the occurrence of plant cell-wall recycling, describe the processes that control wall turnover and metabolic salvage, discuss promising new tools for further investigating wall recycling, and speculate on developmental processes to which wall recycling might contribute, in order to ...The cell wall (CW) of bacteria is an intricate arrangement of macromolecules, at least constituted of peptidoglycan (PG) but also of (lipo)teichoic acids, various polysaccharides, polyglutamate and/or proteins. During bacterial growth and division, there is a constant balance between CW degradation and biosynthesis.While useful information about cell wall constituents could be obtained from such residues, their inherent disadvantages have often been overlooked. For example, most of the cytoplasmic proteins (from membranes, enzymes, etc.), nucleic acids and reserve polysaccharides like starch are co-precipitated with the residues in addition to ...Interestingly, pore traits of cell wall, especial for microcosmic interface structure, seemed to be a crucial factor that correlated to cellulase adsorption and further affected saccharification. Highly heterogeneity in cell wall traits influenced the overall saccharification efficiency of biomass. Furthermore, the holistic outlook ...

We contrast a new continuous approach (CA) for estimating plot-level above-ground biomass (AGB) in forest inventories with the current approach of estimating AGB exclusively from the tree-level AGB predicted for each tree in a plot, henceforth called DA (discrete approach). With the CA, the AGB in a forest is modelled as a continuous ...Estimating above-ground biomass (AGB) accurately includes several steps, such as the assignment of a wood density value to a tree, the choice of a biomass allometric model or the choice of a heightâdiameter (HâD) model when tree height data are incomplete or absent.Above-ground biomass was determined from shoots cut at ground level from the central six rows of each plot along 1.0 m in length (sample area of 1.08 Ã 1.0 m = 1.08 m 2).

ConclusionsThe standing above-ground biomass (AGB) of these forests constitutes about 80 % of terrestrial AGB, which amounts to 432 billion Mg of dry matter, (averaging 109 Mg ha â1; ). Within the forested area, increases in AGB (carbon) occur through growth, with rates of uptake greater for forests in the early stages of regeneration but slowing ...Biomass was measured at plot level at eight contrasting sites to test the accuracy of prediction of tonnes dry matter of above-ground biomass per hectare using different classes of allometric equations. A finer-scale analysis tested performance of these at an individual-tree level across a wider range of sites. Although the ...In this investigation, optical (SPOT-7 NAOMI), airborne LiDAR, and PolInSAR L-band data, along with forest inventories, were employed to develop models for estimating total dry aboveground biomass (AGB) over the tropical forests in the Congo Basin (Gabon) of Central Africa.We used two different data sets of field plots for calculating aboveground biomass, National Forest Inventory (NFI) plots sampled between 2009 and 2014 and Intensive Carbon Monitoring (ICM) plots sampled in 2014 and 2015.Using an extensive database of 110 897 AGB measurements from field inventory plots, we show that the spatial patterns and magnitude of AGB are well captured in our map with the exception of regional uncertainties in high-carbon-stock forests with AGB >250 Mg haâ1, where the retrieval was effectively based on a single radar observation.

The Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program (TNSFP) is the largest ecological restoration project in the world, and has been ongoing for over 40 years. In this study, we developed models to estimate the planted forest aboveground biomass (PF_AGB ...

Following the nitrogen determination, crude protein content is calculated using a conversion factor. The original, and still frequently used, conversion factor 6.25 is based on an assumption that the general nitrogen content in food proteins is 16% and that all nitrogen in foods is protein-bound.We found that only six genera offer pollen with low protein concentration (crude protein < 20%), including two main crop species: sunflowers (Helianthus: median around 15%) and maize (Zea: median around 16%). Most other plant genera offer pollen of comparable protein concentration (Fig. 2).Simple linear regression equations to predict indispensable amino acids (% on a dry matter basis) using concentration of crude protein (% on a dry matter basis) in soybean meals (n = 64). â¦The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary crude protein (CP) concentrations, grain types and arginine:lysine ratios on performance parameters of broiler chickens.

An essential variable in the context of terrestrial carbon fluxes is aboveground biomass (AGB) density, usually defined as the aboveground standing dry mass of live or dead matter, and typically expressed as mass per unit area (e.g. Mg ha â1) for mapped products (Duncanson et al., 2021).Above ground biomass (AGB) is defined as âthe aboveground standing dry mass of live or dead matter from tree or shrub (woody) life forms, expressed as a mass per unit areaâ , typically Mg ha â1. Urban trees can account for up to 97% of urban AGB . AGB can only be directly measured with destructive harvesting, an expensive and ...We set out to answer whether a 50% reduction in incident rainfall would reduce above ground dry matter (biomass) production; alter the biomass proportions from different plant functional types; and reduce regrowth of vegetation after a summer hay cut. The rainfall manipulation experiment was set up as part of the Drought Risk and You ...Dead aboveground biomass has a great effect on shading, and may cause a serious internal competition for light resources (Tanaka et al., 2016). The quality of harvested roughage may also be degraded by dead aboveground biomass. Thus, dead aboveground biomass was removed from all treatments at sites W and E on February 3 and 5 of 2015 ...Biomass, for the purposes of CEOS LPV, is defined as the dry mass of live or dead matter from tree or shrub (woody plant) life forms, typically expressed as a per area density (e.g. Mg of aboveground biomass per hectare). Thus, this does not include non-woody or belowground biomass.This indicator aims to monitor the amount of carbon stored in forests worldwide. Forests store carbon in their above- and belowground live biomass, dead wood and litter, and soils.In summary, plantlets transplanted during the first year led to an immediate reduction in dry matter concentration, recovering from the end of June onward (50 days after transplanting (DAT)) to reach values of about 400 and 500 mg g â1 for rhizome and aboveground biomass, respectively. In the second and third years, similar trends ...Dry matter of living (a, b) and dead (c, d) aboveground biomass above and below 7 cm of L. perenne at two levels of N fertilisation (Lp, LphighN) and of T. repens (Tr), under rainfed control...Aboveground live dry matter comprised 76% of the total live plus dead organic matter in these 10 stands, based on the FCP, so the contribution from dead organic matter was relatively small.

However, the xylose content of the obtained hemicellulose was slightly decreased. Xylose was the dominant component in water-soluble hemicellulose (69.05%) and alkali-soluble hemicellulose (85.83%). In addition, the content of ...The aims of this review are to summary the recent developments and various applications of hemicellulose from wheat straw. The microstructure and molecule of hemicellulose extracted by different methods are comparably discussed. The hemicellulose-based derivatives and composites are also reviewed.The hemicellulose extracted from B-HWP was relatively pure with zero percent lignin and 89.5% xylose content whereas the partially delignified SWG hemicellulose contained about 6-3% lignin and 72â82% xylose, depending on the NaOH concentration during extraction (3â17% NaOH solution).Cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin as the main components of the cell wall [ [1], [2], [3]], and their contents are normally in the range of 40â60 wt%, 20â40 wt%, and 10â25 wt% of dry biomass, respectively.Under the optimal process conditions of 10wt% KOH combined with 3%NaBO 3 at 85 â for 3 h, the removal rate of hemicellulose could reach 83.34% and the recovery rate was 64.50% Meanwhile, the extracted hemicellulose possessed significantly low color value and high molecular (23.35 kDa).In 2016, authors investigated the change in proton concentration for bamboo hemicellulose between autohydrolysis and dilute acid hydrolysis (Kapu et al., 2016).

Normal potassium (K +) homeostasis maintains plasma K + concentration within a narrow range and is achieved by matching K + intake with excretion and ensuring proper distribution between extra- and intracellular fluid compartments.Potassium (K +) is the most abundant intracellular cation. Of the 3,500 mEq that constitute the total pool of the body, about 98% is confined to the intracellular fluid (ICF), at concentrations of 140-150 mEq/l, and only 2% (nearly 70 mEq) is located in the extracellular fluids (ECF), where it ranges from 3.5 to 5 mEq/l.Maintaining normal potassium (K +) concentrations in the extra- and intracellular fluid is critical for cell function. K + homeostasis is achieved by ensuring proper distribution between extra- and intracellular fluid compartments and by matching K + excretion with intake.Intracellular potassium concentration is 150 mmol/L (5.9 g/L), with the remainder present in the extracellular fluid. The extracellular fluid concentration of potassium is rather strictly maintained at a concentration of 3.5â5.5 mmol/L (137â215 mg/L).The average potassium concentration was found to be significantly higher in males \ ( (2846 \pm 525 \upmu g/g)\) compared to females \ ( (2116.2 \pm 432 \upmu g/g)\). We also observed a...Continuing Education Activity Potassium is an essential mineral constituent of the human body and is the chief cation found within the intracellular fluid of all cells. The chief indication for potassium administration is potassium deficiency or hypokalemia, a condition in which serum potassium level falls below a critical range.Potassium is the major cation in the ICF, and the intracellular potassium concentration is approximately 150 mmol l â1. In the ECF, however, the plasma potassium level normally ranges from only 3.5 to 5.0 mmol l â1 .Potassium, magnesium, calcium, urea, creatinine, bicarbonate and pH were measured from each blood test. Blood potassium concentrations values for each blood test are given in Table 2. ECG measurementsBy reviewing the general principles of bacterial membrane physiology and describing the molecular architecture and function of several bacterial K + -transporting systems, we aim to provide a framework for microbiologists studying bacterial potassium homeostasis and the many K + -translocating systems that are still poorly understood.The reference ranges for blood potassium levels are as follows [ 1] : Adult/elderly: 3.5-5.0 mEq/L or 3.5-5.0 mmol/L (SI units) Child: 3.4-4.7 mEq/L. Infant: 4.1-5.3 mEq/L. Newborn: 3.9-5.9 mEq/L. Results can be affected by diet, infusion of potassium-containing fluids, or an infusion of glucose or insulin.

In this work, a new spectroscopic method, called the CASA lignin method, was established for measuring the lignin content of lignocellulosic biomass by UV spectrophotometry, based on the full dissolution of whole biomass in 72% sulfuric acid (SA) containing the amino acid cysteine.Thus, solubility of lignin depends on absolute concentration of the base. The discussed results are consistent with the understanding of lignin dissolution as fractionation based on the acidâbase properties of dissolving fractions.properties of lignin to absorb radiation in specific regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Because lignin has stronger absorbance to UV light at a wavelength of 280 nm than carbo-hydrates, UV-microspectrophotometry was applied to measure lignin concentrations in cell walls of specific plant tissues.28,29Lignin analysis: the analyses of the pre-dried KSW, KHW, OHW, and SOD lignins described above were performed by first accurately weighing approximately 30 mg of lignin to the nearest 0.1 mg. To the lignin, 0.3 mL of the CDCl 3 /pyridine mixture were added, along with 0.2 mL of DMF. Then, 0.1 mL each of the internal calibrant and ...We found a lignin content of 20.52 Â± 7.7% (mean Â± SD) in the fine roots of mixed grassland communities of the Jena Experiment.

The value is 145 to 155 mEq/L of plasma water, a point to be noted because in a few circumstances there are significant changes in the plasma water concentration. Go to: TechniqueIn the combined data set plasma sodium level was significantly associated with ECFV (B [SE] = 0.10 [0.04], p = 0.02), and systolic blood pressure (SBP, B [SE] = 0.73 [0.26], p = 0.006), independent of ECFV. In conclusion, plasma sodium concentration is positively associated with ECFV on both LS and HS intake.Sodium is second only to protons in having the most sensitive biologically relevant MR signal. The considerably lower concentration (e.g. 35 mM sodium ions compared to 80M protons in human brain) and its four fold lower intrinsic sensitivity presented a significant barrier to early 23 Na MR imaging.Abstract. In this feasibility study we propose a method based on sodium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for estimating simultaneously the intracellular sodium concentration (C 1, in mM) and the extracellular volume fraction (Î±) in grey and white matters (GM, WM) in brain in vivo.The present investigation has addressed this issue by using ethyl isopropyl amiloride (EIPA), a specific and potent inhibitor of Na + -H + exchange ( Geibel et al. 1989 ), to assess the extent of Na + -H + exchange in loops of Henle perfused in vivo. The loop of Henle is a heterogeneous nephron segment.Tissue sodium concentration across the whole brain was estimated from sodium MRI maps acquired at 3 T and compared between 24 patients with Friedreich ataxia (21â57 years old, 13 females) and 23 controls (21â60 years old, 12 females).

NDF: neutral detergent fiber; IVDMD: in vitro dry matter digestibility; IVNDFD48: in vitro neutral detergent fiber digestibility after 48 h incubation. Concerning IVDMD, 10 AIBPs had medium to high values ( P < 0.05) ranging from 48.9% to 90.4%, while 5 AIBPs had noticeably low IVDMD that were less than 34% ( Table 2 and Fig. 2 c).Introduction Recently, forage testing laboratories have begun to evaluate forages for neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility. Evaluation of forages for NDF digestibility is being conducted to aid prediction of total forage digestibility. There are several important reasons why forages are being evaluated for NDF digestibility.Digestibility of NDF in vitro or in situ might be a better indicator of DMI than NDF digestibility in vivo because forages with high in vitro or in situ NDF digestibilities might have shorter rumen retention times, allowing greater DMI at the expense of NDF digestibility in vivo.A new in vitro lab assay has been developed that predicts total tract NDF digestion (TTNDFD) in ruminants. The test is based on a patented and licensed in vitro assay and model of fibre digestion. The in vitro TTNDFD assay is available through commercial labs and has been calibrated to NIR analysis.This work aimed to verify (i) whether the in vivo method with uNDF could be used to evaluate diet digestibility in growing pigs, and (ii) whether pre-treating the samples with neutral detergent solution (NDS) and Î±-amylase improves the accuracy of the estimates.The in vitro total-tract NDF digestibility ( TTNDFD) test predicts NDF digestion for alfalfa, corn silage, grass forages and byproduct feeds. UW-Madison researchers have validated the accuracy of the in vitro TTNDFD test against directly measured NDF digestibility in lactating dairy cattle.In vitro methods evaluated DM, N, and NDF digestibility and fermentability of 2 corn DDGS samples from U.S. (POET and ICM), 2 DDGS samples from Brazil (BR1 and BR2), 1 corn fiber and solubles sample (CF+S), 3 high protein distillers grains (HP-DDG) samples (BR-HP, US-HP, US-HPG1.5), and 2 HP-DDG samples containing high yeast (Ultramax; UM) and ...Method to measure in vitro neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility (ivNDFD) based on a primed rumen fluid inoculum.Rate of pdNDF digestion can be determined by measuring the degradation of NDF in ruminal in vitro or in situ incubations at multiple time points, and fitting the change in residual pdNDF by time with log-transformed linear first order or nonlinear mathematical treatments.In vitro neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility (NDFD) is an empirical measurement of fiber fermentability by rumen microbes. Variation is inherent in all assays and may be increased as multiple steps or differing procedures are used to assess an empirical measure.

In vitro incubations were performed under a randomized complete block design with four independent runs of each treatment.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro digestibility value of fermented cocoa pods using the NIRS method of feed analysis. This study used 18 samples of fermented cocoa shell waste, where the material used was fermented cocoa pod skin (KBK) then in vitro analysis was carried out. Samples were acquired spectrum by Thermo Integrative.The objective of the present study was to determine the precision with which laboratory and in situ measurements could predict the digestible organic matter in dry matter (DOMD) in vivo of mountain forages, using multiple linear, step-wise regression analyses.The meta-analysis results indicate that equations, containing apparent dry matter (DM) digestibility, total VFA production, propionate, valerate and feed type (forage vs. concentrate) resulted in best prediction of CH 4.Abstract. In vitro organic matter apparent digestibility (IVOMAD), true digestibility (IVOMTD), metabolizable energy (ME), net energy lactation (NEL), microbial nitrogen (MN) and synthesis of microbial biomass (MBM) were estimated to predict the nutritive values of some agricultural by-products, drought-tolerant range plants and browses.A simple technique for the determination in vitro of the dry- or organic-matter digestibility of small (0Â·5 g) samples of dried forages is described. It involves incubation first with rumen liquor and then with acid pepsin. Using 146 samples of grass, clover and lucerne of known in vivo digestibility ( Y ), the regression equation Y = 0Â·99 X ...

Changes in concentrations of soluble sugars are a very rapid response of Arabidopsis to low temperature, occurring as quickly as 2 h after exposure to 1 Â°C ( Wanner & Junttila 1999 ).In today's context, the survival of plants under environmental stress is an extensive area of research. In addition, increase in the concentration of soluble sugars such as, glucose, sucrose and fructose enhances plant tolerance to several abiotic stresses, such as drought, salinity and cold (Rathinasabapathi, 2000).Soluble sugars, mostly comprised of glucose, fructose and sucrose, may be determined using refractometry or colorimetry. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is the mostly used technique for analysis of individual compounds ( Ma et al., 2014 ).Sensing intracellular soluble sugar pathways, however, provides incomplete information about the metabolic status of plant cells, since they ignore the concentration of soluble sugars in the apoplast and, perhaps more importantly, the apoplast-cytosol and the vacuole-cytosol fluxes of sugars. Consequently, a complex signalling network underlying to sugar-sensing pathways is present.The content and the ratio of soluble sugars and organic acids in fruits are significant indicators for fruit quality. They are affected by multiple environmental factors, in which water-deficient is the most concern. Previous studies found that the content of soluble sugars and organic acids in fruit displayed great differences under ...Soluble sugars are metabolic substrates that play a fundamental role in controlling several processes in diverse plant developmental phases. Sugars such as glucose, sucrose and fructose are reported throughout the plant kingdom and have a dominant role in structure and metabolism at the cellular and whole-plant level.At maturity, grape showed the highest soluble sugar concentrations (16.5â26.3 g/100 g FW), followed by peach (2.2 to 20 g/100 g FW) and tomato (1.4 to 5 g/100 g FW). Main processes determining soluble sugar concentration were decomposed into sugar importation, metabolism, and water dilution with the process-based analysis.Fruit species also showed a large diversity in soluble sugar concentration at maturity, with grape having the highest soluble sugar concentrations (16.5 to 26.3 g/100 g FW), followed by peach (2.2 to 20 g/100 g FW), cherry tomato (3.5 to 6.1 g/100 g FW), and tomato (1.4 to 5 g/100 g FW; Figure 1 ).The freezing tolerance and soluble sugar concentration of grape buds were measured monthly during the dormant season in the field and at 2wk, 4wk, and 6wk after ABA application in the greenhouse. It was observed that fructose, glucose, and sucrose are the main soluble sugars that correlate with freezing tolerance of grape buds and ...The use of phenolâsulfuric acid with a phenol concentration of 2% provided a relatively simple and reliable colorimetric method to quantify the total soluble-sugar concentration.

Sucrose levels ranging from 2000 to 8000 kg ha â1 were recorded between August and September of each year.Group B had higher fresh biomass, total dry matter percentages, and dry biomass-related traits. The IGH KGS 99-100 and ISHs GU 07-3704, KGS 2004-13, KGS 2004-186, KGS 2004-60 and 99-489 can be ...Df = degrees of freedom.. Standardization was done by division of aboveground biomass by the mean biomass per treatment. We obtained results from different linear mixed effects model analyses: treatment was fitted as a factor with four levels in model A and depicted into a year (2003 vs. 2017, according to Table 1), a soil history (â SH vs. + SH, according to Table 1) and a plant history ...

The root/shoot ratio (RSR) is the ratio of the belowground biomass to the aboveground biomass, which is the parameter that most directly reflects biomass allocation by plants. Many plants would change their RSR in response to shading or low nutrient availability ( Reynolds and D'antonio, 1996 ; Aphalo et al., 1999 ), so RSR is an ...Using data from 108 destructively harvested trees belonging to 36 miombo species, we estimated root to shoot ratios, and developed models for estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB), BGB and total biomass C stocks in the Copperbelt province of Zambia. We also validated our models using independent datasets from elsewhere in Zambia ...Mediterranean landscapes. This study developed and tested models to predict the belowground biomass and root/shoot ratio using aboveground field measures. The predictive power of such indirect measurement is useful for a rapid and reliable assessment of the biomass of the Mediterranean species.That is, plants will allocate relatively more biomass to roots if the limiting factor for growth is below ground (e.g. nutrients, water), whereas they will allocate relatively more biomass to shoots if the limiting factor is above ground (e.g. light, CO 2). The âfunctionalâ aspect of this response is that it probably increases ...Step 1 Calculate biomass of VOB: = 300 m 3 /ha x 0.65 t/m 3 = 194 t/ha Step 2 Calculate the BEF (Eq. 3.1.4): BV > 190 t/ha, therefore BEF = 1.74 Step 3 Calculate aboveground biomass density (Eq. 3.1.1): = 1.74 x 300 x 0.65 = 338 t/ha. Example 2. Broadleaf forest with a VOB = 150 m 3 /ha and weighted average wood density, WD = 0.55 t/m 3Estimating above-ground biomass (AGB) accurately includes several steps, such as the assignment of a wood density value to a tree, the choice of a biomass allometric model or the choice of a heightâdiameter (HâD) model when tree height data are incomplete or absent.The present study aimed (1) to develop allometric equations to estimate the above- and below-ground biomass of L. sibirica trees, and (2) to estimate the root/shoot ratio applicable for estimating the root biomass based on above-ground biomass of natural larch forests in northern Mongolia.We developed an approach for harmonizing vegetation-specific maps of both above and belowground biomass into a single, comprehensive representation of each. We overlaid input maps and allocated ...It is not feasible to estimate the root to shoot ratio or develop a root biomass equation linking above-ground biomass to root biomass in the case of non-tree vegetation such as herbs, shrubs and grasses; with such plants, the soil core method is the one most commonly used for the purpose. The broad steps in estimating theFig. 7: Illustration of our main finding of warming effects on plant total biomass, above- and belowground biomass, and root:shoot ratio. a Biomes with low mean annual precipitation (MAP ...

The root/shoot ratio (RSR) is the ratio of the belowground biomass to the aboveground biomass, which is the parameter that most directly reflects biomass allocation by plants. Many plants would change their RSR in response to shading or low nutrient availability ( Reynolds and D'antonio, 1996 ; Aphalo et al., 1999 ), so RSR is an important ...Mediterranean landscapes. This study developed and tested models to predict the belowground biomass and root/shoot ratio using aboveground field measures. The predictive power of such indirect measurement is useful for a rapid and reliable assessment of the biomass of the Mediterranean species.The study estimates that roots make up 22% of total forest biomass, 47% of total shrubland biomass, and 67% of total grassland biomass. Globally, the below- ground portion of plants is 24%, meaning nearly a quarter of the carbon stored by plants world- wide is underground.Formulae display:? Globally, belowground biomass (BGB) accounts for 20â26% of total biomass, and as such it is an important carbon (C) pool for many vegetation types. However, large uncertainty exists for belowground biomass C compared to aboveground stocks.The present study aimed (1) to develop allometric equations to estimate the above- and below-ground biomass of L. sibirica trees, and (2) to estimate the root/shoot ratio applicable for estimating the root biomass based on above-ground biomass of natural larch forests in northern Mongolia.BIOMASS performs a number of standard tasks on input forest tree inventories: (i) tree species identification, if available, is automatically corrected; (ii) wood density is estimated from tree species identity; (iii) if height data are available, a local heightâdiameter allometry may be built; else height is inferred from pantropical or regiona...open access â¢ 441 root:shoot records were compiled for 32 locations in south temperate forests. â¢ Root:shoot ratios were size-invariant in most tree taxa assessed. â¢ Most dicots had similar root:shoot ratios between south and north temperate forests. â¢ Divergences in root allocation were only noted for gymnosperms and tree ferns. â¢Fig. 7: Illustration of our main finding of warming effects on plant total biomass, above- and belowground biomass, and root:shoot ratio. a Biomes with low mean annual precipitation (MAP ...Allometric equation Aboveground biomass Belowground biomass Regression equation Root to shoot ratio Seedling Sapling Species specific equation Tropical dry deciduous forest Abbreviations D diameter HA poor understanding of the fraction of global plant biomass occurring belowground as roots limits our understanding of present and future ecosystem function and carbon pools.

All crops required a lower herbicide intensity when grown in longer rotations: on average TFI decreased by 19% and 11% resp. depending on the location, and NAI decreased by 0.3 on average per year. Highest yields were harvested with a medium to high weed control target.The aim was to quantify the influence of the real-time application of variable herbicide rates on the amount of herbicides used, grain yield and late weed infestation. In 13 field trials average herbicide savings of 24.6% were achieved (cereals: 22.8%, pea: 27.9%), and compared with conventional application on average no yield ...Gravesen L (2003) The Treatment Frequency Index: an indicator for pesticide use and dependency as well as overall load on the environment. Reducing pesticide dependency in Europe to protect health, environment and biodiversity, Copenhagen, Pesticides Action Network Europe (PAN), Pure Conference.Among the recorded systems, herbicide treatment frequency index (HTFI) averaged over rotation increased when tillage frequency decreased. No recorded no-till system was herbicide-free. The untilled crops with the lowest HTFI (0.16) were unusual crops, i.e., relay grass-crops or multi-annual crops.Two indicators were used for the amount of herbicide applied: the total application rate and the treatment frequency index (SM Materials and Methods). LMM were analysed with a type III...Given a strongly right-skewed distribution, we log transformed application frequency. We adopted a common measure of pesticide intensity, the rate of application (Steinmann 2018), calculated as the amount of AI by extent of application (kg ha â1).

Pierson et al. (2007b) found an increase from 16% to 36% ground cover greatly reduced rill erosion in western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis Hooker) communities. Packer (1951) found 70% ground cover was about equal to 90% for control of overland flow and erosion on perennial wheatgrass sites on gradients of 33â66%. He suggested 70 ...Plant cover was estimated as the vertical projection of all above-ground organs such that the total vegetation cover may exceed 100%. The cover of flowering nectariferous plants and total ...First, by providing ground cover, plants reduced soil erosion rates dramatically. Second, by growing along stream margins, plants stabilized channel banks and defined a new relationship between stable streams and periodically inundated floodplains.The relationship between ground cover (%) and soil loss via surface erosion is significant and potentially non-linear, with rapid increases in surface erosion as ground cover falls below 30% ( Greene et al., 1994; Silburn et al., 2011 ).Crop improvement efforts are targeting increased above-ground biomass and radiation-use efficiency as drivers for greater yield. Early ground cover and canopy height contribute to biomass production, but manual measurements of these traits, and in particular above-ground biomass, are slow and labor-intensive, more so when made at multiple developmental stages. These constraints limit the ...Perennial groundcovers can improve vegetative cover in both annual and perennial cash-crop production. Incorporating low-growing, non-competitive (i.e. ecologically complementary) PGC into cash-crop fields restores continuous vegetative cover without interfering with cash-crop productivity ( Figure 1C ).Tradescantia fluminensis biomass increased dramatically at > 80% cover, with few native species able to persist at such high levels of invasion. Landscape context had almost no influence on...Maintaining ground cover is one of the most efficient ways of ensuring long-term sustainability of rangelands via soil conservation as 1) ground cover plays a direct role on the condition and trend of soils and 2) ground cover may be directly affected through land management activities including grazing ( Bates et al. 2009; Bork et al. 2012 ).Hay harvest had a strong negative effect on bare-ground cover (P = < 0.001, Supplementary Table S4): bare ground increased from 4.2 Â± 0.85% in no hay harvested plots to 21.0 Â± 1.70% in hay ...Cover can be measured for the entire vegetation in an area (e.g., "total vegetative cover was 45%"), or can be applied to individual species (e.g., "sagebrush cover was 10 to 15%"). Four Types of Cover. Basal Cover = The proportion of the plant that extends into the soil. Compared to other estimates of cover, basal cover is:

Abstract Phyllochron KeywordsBiophysical crop models convert GDD accumulation to leaf numbers by using a constant parameter termed phyllochron (Â°C-day leaf â1) or leaf appearance rate (LAR; leaf o C-day â1 ). However, such important parameter values are rarely estimated for modern maize hybrids.The average rate of leaf tip appearance was 0.022 leaf (Â°C d) â1; the plastochron was 45.7 Â°C d per leaf. The thermal duration of leaf expansion, i.e. the horizontal distance between leaf tip appearance and ligule appearance ( Fig. 1 a), depended on leaf number, but was not systematically affected by N supply and did not differ ...Results indicated that new 111-day hybrids produce leaves faster than old hybrids throughout the vegetative phase (7.4% and 3.1% faster before and after the ninth leaf stage, respectively), whereas new 103-day hybrids produce leaves faster only after the ninth leaf stage (9.4%).... The ALN on a stem or plant is associated with the leaf area expansion, and this is due to the interception of solar radiation, photosynthesis and accumulation of biomass by the crop (Streck...Plant height, plant leaf area, leaf number per plant, individual leaf area and dry weight, stem diameter, specific leaf weight (SLW), and leaf weight ratio (LWR) in bell pepper as a function of ...This study has been designed to estimate leaf lifespan, leaf production ( Lp) and leaf death ( Ld) rates, the age structure of leaves, and the decline in maximum photosynthetic rate ( Amax) with age in plants of Ipomoea pes-caprae growing with a full supply of nutrients and with a low Ca supply.From the emergence to the V10 stage, leaf collar emergence occurs at â¼29.5 Â°C d per leaf for upper leaves (the 13 th and higher), and LCA is â¼10 Â°C d/leaf (Wuethrich, 1997). The leaf-appearance rates are 61.7 Â°C d per leaf for the first through 12 th leaves and 35.3 Â°Cd per leaf for the 13 th and higher leaves (Muchow and ...Biophysical crop models convert GDD accumulation to leaf numbers by using a constant parameter termed phyllochron (Â°C-day leaf -1) or leaf appearance rate (LAR; leaf o C-day -1 ).

In addition to cover crop traits, in the weed control trials, we assessed two weed control efficiency indices in terms of weed ground cover (WCE COV) and biomass (WCE DM). Like for cover crop traits, a mean ground cover index for weed over time (COV Weed) was calculated in each plot in each trial.While cover crops reduced weed ground cover and dry mass by 60% and 68% on average in summer and winter, respectively, a higher number of cover crop species within a mixture did not increase mean weed control. Nonetheless, weed control was influenced by the mixture composition and improved when including Guizotia abyssinica.Weed control efficiency represents efficiency of weeds control by treatments in comparison with weedy check. Highest weed control efficiency was recorded in weed free plot (T 8) i.e. 96.57 per cent followed by treatment (T 4) Pendimethalin 30% EC @ 1kg a.i./ha (PE) + Imazethapyr 10% SL @ 100g a.i./ha (PoE) 78.00%. Treatment (T 7) weedy check ...The most common methods of weed suppression by an actively growing cover crop include competition for limited plant growth resources that result in reduced weed biomass, seed production, and hence reductions in the addition of seeds to the soil seedbank.The thermal control of weeds is based on the use of fire, flaming, hot water, steam and freezing, which provide rapid weed control without leaving chemical residues in the soil and water. Moreover, thermal methods are selective towards the weeds, do not disturb the soil and, therefore, do not bring the buried seeds to the soil ...Weed index is the measure of the efficiency of a particular treatment when compared with a weed free treatment. It is expressed as percentage of yield potential under weed free. More...Here, we review services and disservices associated with weeds in annual agroecosystems and present two case studies from the United States to illustrate how weeds growing in fall-planted cover crops can provide ground cover, decrease potential soil losses, and effectively manage nitrogen. We argue that in certain circumstances ...Common cover crops for weed control could be classified in four-group bases taxonomy: cereals, legumes, non-legumes, and brassicaceae plants . One of the cereals, rye (Cereale secale L.), is most commonly used as a winter cover crop in soybean and corn as it provides reasonable weed control and yield .Physical weed control measures such as burning, flame weeding, and soil steaming can be used to effectively control weed emergence and growth through plant or seed exposure to high temperatures. An integrated approach incorporating soil steaming, cover crops, and mulching can result in reduced herbicide reliance and effective weed ...To reduce reliance on herbicides and maintain crop productivity, integrated weed management (IWM) seeks to optimize synergies between diverse sets of weed management practices combined at the cropping system scale. Nevertheless, data on weed community response to the long-term implementation of IWM practices remain scare. Here, we ...

Furthermore, it is ...A field study was conducted at CSIR-IHBT, Palampur, India during 2018 and 2019 to analyze the efficacy of herbicides in combination with manual weeding on weed control and the yield of wild marigold ( Tagetes minuta L).Total weed density prior to weed control ranged from 0.2 to 319.4 plants.m â 2 and averaged 39.2 plants.m â 2. Total weed density varied by cropping system ( Table 2 ), and was higher in the four IWM systems compared to the reference system, where weed density was very low (averaging 3.8 plants.m â 2 ).Weed control efficiency was assessed through the ratio of weed groundcover to maize groundcover development (GC weed) and dominant weed species development (DWS, presence-absence), also grouped by life form (DWS group ), related to the groundcover of each species over time.Weed control âeventsâ associated with objects in the relevant classes combine to define the weed management system; the level at which outcomes are predicted (weed abundance, diversity, yield loss and evolution of resistance). The competition of the crop canopy is defined by an additional class.

One way to estimate speed of emergence is to calculate the number of days to reach 50 percent emergence. An example for 100 plants/m 2 (i.e. 18 seeds/m of row as in the example above) is shown in the table above. In this example the number of days to 50 percent emergence is: [(50-39)/(61-39)] + 7 = 7.5 days.Over all years and locations of this study, the number of days from sowing to 50% seedling emergence (DSE) ranged from 5 to 39 and averaged 12.2. Assuming sowing depth was 5 cm, the DSSAT-CSM model underestimated DSE in 94% of the site-years and averaged 4.8 days less than the observations (Table 3 and Fig. 2).The results regarding the days to 50% seed germination (Figure 1 a) revealed that the seeds left untreated (control) germinated in a maximum (32.02) number of days. The seeds treated...Over all years and locations of this study, the number of days from sowing to 50% seedling emergence (DSE) ranged from 5 to 39 and averaged 12.2. Assuming sowing depth was 5 cm, the DSSAT-CSM model underestimated DSE in 94% of the site-years and averaged 4.8 days less than the observations ( Table 3 and Fig. 2 ).Half-maximal germination (G50) was the number of days after sowing needed to reach 50% of the total germination, estimated in this study through the interpolation of one day before and 1 day after 50% of total germination was achieved.... to emergence varied between 6 days for the 18 May 2002 sowing and 21 days for the 15 January 2002 sowing.

Maximum mean percentage emergence of each species was calculated from the mean number of seed sown. Seedlings were harvested 60 and 150 days after emergence. Harvesting of seedlings sown in March commenced on 1st June 2010, with the second harvest on 1st September 2010. May sown ...To evaluate the transgenerational effects of temperature stress on the progeny fitness, in vitro seed germination parameters, such as maximum seed germination, time to 50% seed germination, and seed germination rate were measured.In the rainfed condition, the results demonstrated a prolonged duration to reach 50% flowering with higher nitrogen (N) application rates. The application of 52.5â110 kg N ha â1 resulted in significantly higher seed yield, while lower (18 kg N ha â1) and higher (156 kg N ha â1) doses of N led to reduced seed yield. Under irrigation conditions, superior seed weights and maximum seed ...The maximum emergence decreased from about 80% to 50%â40% with delay in sowing after irrigation. Seedling vigour as measured by shoot dry weight at 43 days after planting followed the pattern of seedling emergence. An advantage of delayed sowing after irrigation was better control of weeds with cultivation before planting.

Basic engineering theory and empirically determined allometric relationships for the biomass partitioning patterns of extant tree-sized plants show that the mechanical requirements for vertical growth do not impose intrinsic limits on the maximum heights that can be reached by species with woody, self-supporting stems.In summary, it was found that plants in crowded stands regulate their height growth to maintain a similar height to their neighbours even when there are potential advantages to height growth. Lifted plants increased neither biomass allocation to leaves nor biomass production, indicating that overtopping neighbours is not necessarily ...Plant height of the surviving plants (from the soil surface to the apical tip or highest aerial part of the plant) was measured 21 days after application (DAA) and at BBCH 89 (generative growth stage, fully ripe plants). The biomass (dry weight) of the plants was determined by cutting the surviving plants at soil level at 21 DAA ...

From the viewpoint of global climate change mitigation, this stand fixed 4.14 Mg ha â1 and 13.93 Mg ha â1 of carbon units and CO 2 molecules into above-ground biomass, respectively.Relative growth rate (RGR), as defined by Watson (1952) in the following equation, was a more generalized expression of the efficiency index proposed by Blackman (1919): RGR = l/m dm/dt. The RGR equation required the additional assumption that crop mass increased as an inverse function of current crop mass.The radiation use efficiency (RUE) of crops is a measure of the conversion of intercepted radiation to biomass. It can be calculated as a function of PAR or solar radiation, using shoots or whole crops, and calculated as the ratio or slope of the regression between biomass and intercepted radiation.Radiation-use efficiency (RUE) is an index used to quantify the relationship between solar radiation and biomass, and crop yield can be increased by increasing RUE. The main goals of this study were to initially investigate the effects of plant densities on the aboveground dry matter of corn, and subsequently examine the effects of ...We evaluated the long-term pattern of leaf area index (LAI) dynamics and radiation use efficiency (RUE) in short rotation poplar in uncoppice (single stem) and coppice (multi-stem) plantations, and compared them to annual field crops (AFCs) as an alternative for bioenergy production while being more sensitive to weather fluctuation and climate c...Aboveground dry mass as a function of global radiation intercepted for different row spacings.

We ...Figures (1) Abstract and Figures Small-seeded plant species are often reported to have high relative growth rate or RGR. However, because RGR declines as plants grow larger, small-seeded...Under frequent disturbance (e.g. tropical grasslands), increased competition for light can be manifested strategically as an increased rate of height growth, or under lower disturbance frequency as increased ultimate height. Physiologically, the same conditions that are conducive to higher LAI (i.e. warm, high rainfall and nutrient ...The present study showed that plants in crowded stands regulate their height growth so as to maintain similar height to neighbours: plants whose top had been lowered relative to their neighbours accelerated the elongation rate while plants whose top had been lifted higher than the neighbours reduced the elongation rate (Fig. 2).

The main goals of this study were to initially investigate the effects of plant densities on the aboveground dry matter of corn, and subsequently examine the effects of plant densities on RUE and leaf area index (LAI), and the effects of LAI on RUE. Finally, we provide a comparative assessment of the approaches used to determine RUE.Across the 49 plots nested into 17 sites, measured aNPP ranged from 99 g dry mass m â2 year â1 in montane heath to a maximum of 1481 g dry mass m â2 year â1 in intensively managed lowland improved grassland (Fig. 2).

Biochar is the product of biomass pyrolysis and has been shown to reduce soil acidity, immobilize metal (loid)s and thus ameliorate plant growth.Overall, our findings are the first to indicate that an increase in organic fertilizer application rate does not necessarily boost antibiotic resistance in agricultural soils, and to define an organic fertilization rate threshold for the enrichment of soil ARGs. In particular, the threshold fertilization rate was 45 t/ha/y, however ...In the first day of incubation, biochar amendment reduced soil C mineralisation rates from 58 to 88% compared to the soil-alone as a function of increasing biochar application rates. This reduction was mainly attributed to the mineralisation of easily available substrates from incomplete pyrolysis, which were preferentially used by ...Biochar application rates from 0.5 to 135 t ha â1 have produced plant growth responses ranging from â29% to 324% [ 12 ]. Plant and soil responses of biochar application also varied with agricultural systems, crop type, climatic conditions [ 13, 14 ], and fertilization status [ 15 ].The increase in CEC is soil-dependent and modulated by high-ash biochar CEC and application rate, as well as by the original soil CEC. The addition of alkaline and high-cation exchange capacity (CEC) biochars is a suitable strategy to increase the CEC of weathered soils.Five treatments were tested: clear cultivation (CC, bare soil without mulching) and four MB application rates of 0.37, 0.74, 1.11, and 1.48 kg m â2. The application of MB reduced runoff generation by 15.5 to 78.6% and sediment yield by 40.7 to 98.6% compared to CC.The resulting sulfur-enriched biochar (SulfaChar) and synthetic S fertiliser (control treatment) were amended to potting soils and the growth response of corn (Zea mays L.) and soybeans [Glycine...

Soil Organic Carbon Content Soil organic carbon, the major component of soil organic matter, is extremely important in all soil processes. Organic material in the soil is essentially derived from residual plant and animal material, synthesised by microbes and decomposed under the influence of temperature, moisture and ambient soil conditions.Soil Organic Carbon. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is one of the most important characteristics of soils that result from the interplay of net primary producers, decomposers, and mineralogy. From: Developments in Soil Science, 2018. Related terms: Carbon Sink; Biochar; Soil Organic Matter; Cropping System; Soil Carbon; Conservation Agriculture ...For 2019, EU Member States reported a loss of carbon from 17.8Mha of land with organic soil (4.2% of the total land area), corresponding to emissions of 108Mt CO 2, while 387.6Mha of mineral soil secured net removals of 44Mt CO 2.Soil organic carbon (the carbon stored in soil organic matter) is crucial to soil health, fertility and ecosystem services, including food production â making its preservation and restoration essential for sustainable development. Soils with high carbon content are likely to be more productive and better able to filter and purify water.The real issue about release of carbon from soils to the atmosphere, however, is how temperature, soil water content and other factors interact to influence decomposition of soil...Organic carbon in the top metre of Earthâs soils is far older than previously thought, averaging 4,800 years old.

Phosphorus is the second most important crop nutrient after Nitrogen. It is an essential macronutrient that plays important role in all crop biochemical processes such as photosynthesis,...For surface and subsurface soils, the mean percentages of WEP, CCEP, and OEP relative to the total were 0.38, 0.32, 4.3, 0.33, 0.33, and 3.68%, respectively. This implies that only a small amount of total P in soils is available and that fractions of WEP and OEP in surface soils were larger than in subsurface soils.Abstract. The fate of phosphorus (P) derived from mineral fertilisers and organic manures, and the effective P balance, have been assessed in three long-term field experiments at Rothamsted (UK), Bad Lauchstaedt (Germany) and Skierniewice (Poland). This paper discusses the plant availability, uptake and overall utilisation of P over the last 30 ...Phosphorus is a fundamental nutrient for primary productivity of ecosystems and agricultural production, but its misuse impacts agricultural sustainability and has important environmental consequences.

Here, we combine spatially distributed global soil erosion estimates (only considering...Phosphorus: P-Balance and P-Content in Soils An indispensable nutrient for plants and animals, phosphorus (P) circulates in fairly large quantities in the plant and animal production sectors. Animals excrete excess phosphorus in their faeces and urine, which is later spread on fields as fertiliser.Phosphorus (P) is an important element in terrestrial ecosystems and plays a critical role in soil quality and ecosystem productivity. Soil total P distributions have undergone large spatial...Soil phosphorus (P) availability is critical to plant productivity in many terrestrial ecosystems. How soil P availability responds to changes in plant diversity remains uncertain, despite the ...Mukherjee et al. (2020) observed that the use of biochar can increase the available phosphorus content in the soil, mobilize reserve phosphorus, reduce the fixation of phosphorus in the soil, and change the phosphatase activity. Zhang et al. (2020a) found that the application of biochar can promote the growth of crop roots, increase crop yield, improve soil structure, and affect crop ...

Leaf nitrogen content (LNC), an indicator for the amount of photosynthetic proteins, plays an important role to understand plant function and status. In previous studies, vegetation indices (VIs) have been demonstrated to monitor LNC non-destructively, but which is influenced by backgrounds, and lacks specificity for nitrogen stress.Plants invest a considerable amount of leaf nitrogen in the photosynthetic enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO), forming a strong coupling of nitrogen and...Higher N content in leaves is associated with higher chlorophyll content and increased chloroplast activity and thus increased photosynthetic productivity. Conclusions: It is possible to...Here, we investigated the content of nitrogen and phosphorus in leaves of different life forms. Leaf P was higher in herb species than in shrub and tree species, while leaf N in shrubs was higher than in herbs and trees (Fig. 1; Fig. 2). The content of N and P in plant leaves showed a significant change across an elevation gradient ...Nitrogen (N) is an essential element required in actively growing tissue for healthy plant growth. It is a component of proteins, chlorophyll, and numerous other organic compounds. N deficiency causes dramatic reductions in plant growth and chlorophyll synthesis, resulting in paleness and yellowing of the leaf (chlorosis).Nitrogen is an essential macronutrient for plants, where its availability is a determinant of plant productivity (Chen et al. ) are the two major forms of N that are absorbed by plants; however, both forms are in short supply in agricultural and natural ecosystems (Crawford and Forde ).Approximately, 30â50% of nitrogen in green leaves is in the form of D-ribulose 1â5-diphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO) (Kokaly, 2001), being the key photosynthetic enzyme/protein in green leaves (Gutteridge and Gatenby, 1995, Andersson and Backlund, 2008).Nitrogen deficiency is characterized by poor plant growth and pale yellow leaves due to insufficient chlorophyll content and some environmental stresses . Nitrogen is a key component of the chlorophyll that intensifies photosynthesis in crops [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ], and plant yield is affected by irregularity in nitrogen content [ 8 , 9 ...Leaf area growth and nitrogen concentration per unit leaf area, N a (g m â2 N) are two options plants can use to adapt to nitrogen limitation. Previous work indicated that potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) adapts the size of leaves to maintain N a and photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf area.This paper reports on the effect of N limitation on leaf area production and photosynthetic capacity in ...

It is well known that phosphorus deficiency in plants disturbs the production of chlorophyll, causing leaf chlorosis [ 7, 8 ]. Prolonged P deficiency may further result in the accumulation of anthocyanins, consequently leading to purple discolouration on the leaf surface [ 9, 10 ].It is found that soil thickness on mainland is higher than on islands, while its soil maximum water content is lower on mainland than on islands; Other facts include: soil total phosphorus(P)...Leaf phosphorus (P) comprises four major fractions; inorganic phosphate (Pi), nucleic acids, phospholipids, Pâcontaining metabolites and a residual fraction.Depending on the plant species, it is estimated that the content of phosphorus derived from phytate ranges from 30 to 60% of the total phosphorus in seeds. It is generally assumed that the major role of Ins P6 in plants is to act as a storage form for Pi, but these compounds also have other physiological roles other than P6 storage ...Commentary As fundamental plant nutrients, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) exert strong controls on the metabolic performance of leaves.Here, we investigated the content of nitrogen and phosphorus in leaves of different life forms.

Determination of Total Potassium Content in Plants. The total potassium content in leaves was determined using a H 2 SO 4-H 2 O 2 flame photometer . Fresh leaves were dried at 85Â°C for 30 min and then at 105Â°C until reaching a constant weight.Potassium (K) is an essential element for regulating plant growth and physiological metabolism. However, little information is available on large-scale spatial variations in leaf potassium concentrations (LKC) in different plant species, the variations in LKC, and the mechanism underlying these variations. Here, we measured LKC in ...Mohammad Sarraf g , Mirza Hasanuzzaman h Add to Mendeley https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2022.01.001 Get rights and content â¢ Potassium has diverse role in plant growth and development. â¢ Potassium is responsible for activation of several vital plant enzymes. â¢Abstract. Potassium (K) is one of three main crop nutrients, and the high rate of potash fertilizer utilization (second only to nitrogen) leads to high prices. Therefore, efficient application, as well as rapid and time monitoring of K in crops is essential. Several turnover box and field experiments were conducted across multiple ...Potassium content in the roots, stems, and leaves of seedlings increased with the increasing in K supply . The K content of all organs was the highest under K12 treatment. In K0 and K3 treatments, the K content of each organ was the highest in leaves, second-highest in the stems, and lowest in roots. Under the other K level ...Changes in the potassium content would unavoidably have an impact on reflectance since there is a direct relationship between potassium content and the color, structure, and moisture content of plant leaves [5,16,17,18,19], which has been confirmed in many related studies.Potassium is the most abundant inorganic cation in nonâhalophytes, contributing up to 6 % of plant dry weight. As a major inorganic osmolyte, K + is crucial for cell osmoregulation and turgor maintenance and, hence, for cell expansion, stomatal function, tropisms and leaf movement.Potassium (K) is the most abundant inorganic cation, and it is important for ensuring optimal plant growth ( White and Karley, 2010 ). K is an activator of dozens of important enzymes, such as protein synthesis, sugar transport, N and C metabolism, and photosynthesis.Last Updated: 12 Jun 2023. PDF | Potassium (K) is one of three main crop nutrients, and the high rate of potash fertilizer utilization (second only to nitrogen) leads to high... | Find, read and ...Abstract. Eucalyptus are widely planted in regions with low rainfall, occasioning frequent drought stresses. To alleviate the stress-induced effects on plants growing in these environments, soil fertilization with potassium (K) may affect drought-adaptive plant mechanisms, notably on tropical soils with low K availability.

A proposed model for calcium distribution and water flow within leaves It has been demonstrated that both the rate and the concentration at which Ca 2+ in the transpiration stream is delivered to leaves are likely to be affected by the pathway of water flow to and through leaves.INTRODUCTION Calcium is an essential plant nutrient. As the divalent cation (Ca 2+ ), it is required for structural roles in the cell wall and membranes, as a counterâcation for inorganic and organic anions in the vacuole, and as an intracellular messenger in the cytosol ( Marschner, 1995 ).In general, calcium deficiency as a result of low soil availability is not very common ( White and Broadley, 2003 ). Deficiency symptoms occur however more often in developing tissue such as young leaves and fruits, due to low remobilization from old to young tissue via the phloem.Various fractions of calcium were qualified in the young and mature leaves as well as tuber tissue. A reduced concentration of water soluble fraction of calcium was most important factor related to the development of calcium deficiency symptoms in the line overexpressing sCAX1.Content of insoluble Ca is lowest in the growing leaves of Â«low CaÂ» plants (0.1%) and highest in the adult leaves of Â«high CaÂ» plants (0.8 %). The amount of calcium oxalate is lowest in the Â«low CaÂ» plants Figure 4. Dry weight per cm 2 leaf blade area.It has been reported that calcium provided a larger number of leaves and ... The results showed that calcium foliar application led to an increase in vitamin C content and calcium content in ...Calcium content in plants ranges between 0.005 to 5% of dry weight, depending on the plant species, tissue type, and environmental conditions (Jones and Lunt, 1967; Demarty et al., 1984; Thor, 2019); 60-75% of calcium is localized in cell walls (Rossignol et al., 1977; Demarty et al., 1984; Pegg et al., 2019).Changes in the nutrient concentrations in roots, trunks, canes, and leaves of Ca 2+ -deficient and Ca 2+ -sufficient grapevines. The nutrient concentrations, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and B ...Total N content was determined by the micro Kjeldahlsâ method. Total K concentration in the leaf was analysed using the flame-photometric method. The calcium content (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) content were determined using an atomic absorption spectrometer (Spektr AA 800, Varian, CA, USA). Statistical analysesInternal distributions of Ca and Mg were determined in transverse leaf sections at the base and apex of leaves using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) with cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM).

Manganese (Mn) is an important micronutrient for plant growth and development and sustains metabolic roles within different plant cell compartments. The metal is an essential cofactor for the oxygen-evolving complex of the photosynthetic machinery, catalyzing the water-splitting reaction in photosystem II (PSII). Despite the ...IntroductionâManganese as an Essential Plant Nutrient. Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient in most organisms. More than 200 years ago, the presence of Mn in leaf tissue of plants was experimentally documented for the first time in the ash of several vegetable species [ 1 ].In this study, we obtained the first direct measurements of the speciation of Mn in the leaves of the Mn-hyperaccumulator P. acinosa leaves using XAS. Results showed that Mn in leaves was bivalent and that almost 90% of the total Mn was Mn-oxalate. The XAS method is based on linear fitting of combinations of the near-edge spectra of ...Manganese toxicity in plants can cause stunting, chlorosis, curled leaves, or brown lesions, as well as inhibiting photosynthesis and respiration. Several elements such as P and Ca are reported...Currently, it is assumed that the average global Mn content is between 450 and 4000 mg Mnâkg â1 (Li et al., 2019 ). Similar values, from 100 to 4000 mg Mnâkg â1, were provided by Helmke in ( 2000 ).The main aim of our study was to determine the content of copper, manganese, zinc, and cadmium in tea leaves and to find out if there are any significant differences among the teas of different types and countries of their origin.The distribution of Mn in the leaves of P. acinosa was controlled mainly by the transpiration rate. Our investigation demonstrated that Mn was readily transported from the roots to shoots of P. acinosa but that it could not be remobilized readily after it reached leaves. Article PDF ReferencesThe total Chl content in the leaves also decreased under Mn-toxic conditions (Fig. 3b). These results indicated that Mn toxicity causes PSII photoinhibition.In roots and in young leaves, Mn accumulated to higher levels in Fe plants than in control plants, while this was not observed in P- or Mn-starved plants exposed to high Mn. In old leaves, by contrast, there was a lower accumulation of Mn in P-deprived plants than in controls. After the Mn shock, similar Mn concentrations were ...Micro-PIXE analysis of cross sections of tea leaves revealed that (i) epidermis contains the largest concentrations of Mg, oxalate crystals contain most of Ca and epidermises and oxalate crystals of Mn, ii) there is a leaf-age effect on tissue-specific concentration of Mg, Ca and Mn with all tissues of old leaves containing larger Mg ...

canonical value of 50%. Plant C content in leaves (global mean of 46.9%) was higher than that in roots (45.6%). Across life forms, woody plants exhibited higher C content than herbaceous plants. Conifers, relative to broad-leaved woody species, had higher C content in roots, leaves, and stems. Plant C content tended to show a decrease with in-Plant carbon content in roots and leaves showed a significant latitudinal trend. Variation partitioning (r 2 ) of climate and life forms to account for the variation in plant carbon...Leaf carbon content (LCC) is widely used as an important parameter in estimating ecosystem carbon (C) storage, as well as for investigating the adaptation strategies of vegetation to their environment at a large scale. In this study, we used a dataset collected from forests (5119 plots) and shrublands (2564 plots) in China, 2011â2015.Carbon absorption capability and morphological traits are crucial for plant leaf function performance. Here, we investigated the five bamboos at different elevations in Wuyi Mountain to clarify how the leaf trait responds to the elevational gradient and drives the photosynthetic capacity variations.Plant C content in leaves (global mean of 46.9 %) was higher than that in roots (45.6 %). Across life forms, woody plants exhibited higher C content than herbaceous plants. Conifers, relative to broad-leaved woody species, had higher C content in roots, leaves, and stems.Plant C content in leaves was higher than that in roots.

Vegetation characteristics reported include species growth habit, leaf area, mass, and mass loss with senescence.The results demonstrate that leaf carbon content may vary during leaf ontogenesis, and that the character of ontogenetic changes in carbon content depends not only on plant species but also on canopy position. Key words: Beech, carbon content, deciduous trees, Fagus sylvatica L., oak, Quercus robur L., seasonal changes.18 markedly across plant organs. Plant organ C content ranged from 45.01% in reproductive organs to 47.88% in stems at 19 global scales, which were significantly lower than a canoni cal value of 50% that has been widely employed in previous 20 studies. Plant C content in leaves was higher than that in roots. Across life forms, woody plants ...From 1979 to 2014, the global precipitation and temperature exhibited an increasing trend, and plants could invest more carbon in leaves and wood tissues to enhance vegetation production as well ...

This suggests that high soluble sugar concentration in the stem of TS is due to a factor other than the small panicle caused by the sp1 mutation. Therefore, in the present study, we characterized sugar metabolism in the stem of TS to obtain clues to the cause of its high sugar concentration.We calculated the allocation of soluble sugar and starch to leaf, stem and roots by multiplying the concentration by organ biomass and dividing by the total soluble sugar and starch biomass in each organ biomass by the whole-plant soluble sugar and starch biomass.In large seedlings, âWC treatment significantly decreased leaf soluble sugar concentration and leaf starch concentration by 40%, when compared to +WC treatment (p < 0.05; Figures 5C,D), and âWDE treatment significantly increased stem and root soluble sugar concentrations, by 69 and 92%, respectively, when compared with the +WDE ...Owing to the changes in the stems of transgenic and WT plants, the soluble sugar (fructose, glucose, and sucrose) and starch concentrations in the T 3 generation of OE11b-1, RNAi11b-5, and WT plants were analyzed (Figs. 7 and 8). OE11b-1 lines had remarkably higher sugar concentrations in their leaves, and their glucose, fructose ...Sensing intracellular soluble sugar pathways, however, provides incomplete information about the metabolic status of plant cells, since they ignore the concentration of soluble sugars in the apoplast and, perhaps more importantly, the apoplast-cytosol and the vacuole-cytosol fluxes of sugars. Consequently, a complex signalling network underlying to sugar-sensing pathways is present.Soluble sugar helps in maintaining the leaf water content and osmotic adjustment of plants subjected to drought stress (Xu et al., 2007). However, decreased utilization of sugar due to restriction of growth may also cause accumulation of sugars in leaves ( Hummel et al., 2010 ).The whole-seedling soluble sugar content was calculated as the sum of fructose, glucose and sucrose in carious tissues, and the NSC pool was obtained by summing up the contents of soluble sugars and starch. The soluble sugar concentrations were measured using 0.2 g of dry mass. Sugars were extracted in 2 mL of 80% v/v ethanol ...Sweet sorghum is able to accumulate remarkable amount of soluble sugars in the stem while ensuring grain filling and for this reason can be used as a dual purpose crop (Rutto et al. 2013 ). Sugar production by sweet sorghum depends on the quantity of sweet juice contained in the stem.Xu et al. (Citation 2015) found that drought stress condition significantly increased soluble sugar concentration in roots and leaves of susceptible rice variety but not in resistant one. In contrast, stem soluble sugar concentration in both susceptible and tolerant genotypes was significantly reduced under drought stress (Xu et al., Citation ...Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) include soluble sugars and starch. These NSCs provide the main energy supply for plant growth, development and reproduction, and perform important functions in...
