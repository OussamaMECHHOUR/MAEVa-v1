The maximum aboveground dry mass is a valuable metric because it signifies the maximum capacity of a plant to store energy and nutrients. The process of accumulating dry matter depends on various factors such as genetics, environmental conditions, and resource availability. Generally, as a plant grows, it starts as a small seedling and gradually increases in size, acquiring more biomass. The rate at which a plant accumulates dry matter can vary based on its growth stage, photosynthetic capacity, nutrient uptake, and water availability. The maximum aboveground dry mass is influenced by genetic factors, including the plant's genetic makeup and its ability to allocate resources efficiently. Some plant species and cultivars have inherent genetic traits that promote higher dry matter accumulation, resulting in greater aboveground biomass. Environmental factors such as temperature, light, and water availability also play a significant role in determining the maximum aboveground dry mass of plants. Optimal conditions that provide ample sunlight, moderate temperatures, and sufficient water availability generally enhance plant growth and biomass production. However, extreme environmental conditions, such as drought, high temperatures, or low light intensity, can limit the plant's ability to accumulate dry matter and may reduce the maximum aboveground dry mass. Crop management practices, including the provision of adequate nutrients through fertilization, can also greatly impact the maximum aboveground dry mass of plants. Nutrient availability, especially essential macronutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, has a direct influence on plant growth and biomass production. Well-balanced nutrient management can optimize the plant's physiological and metabolic processes, resulting in increased dry matter accumulation. Understanding the maximum aboveground dry mass of crops is crucial for estimating potential yield and determining the optimal harvest time. It provides valuable insights into the productivity and biomass production of crop plants, which are essential for crop management decisions, such as fertilization, irrigation, and harvesting techniques. Furthermore, knowledge of the maximum aboveground dry mass can aid in breeding programs aimed at developing high-yielding and resource-efficient varieties with increased biomass accumulation 

The variable "Leaf dry mass per aboveground dry mass" refers to the ratio or proportion of dry mass in the leaves of a plant to the total dry mass of the aboveground parts of the plant. It is a key parameter used to understand and evaluate the efficiency of photosynthesis and carbon allocation within a plant. The dry mass of a plant refers to the weight of the plant's tissues after all moisture has been removed. Dry mass is an important measure as it represents the plant's actual biomass and provides a more accurate indication of its growth and productivity compared to fresh weight measurements. In the case of the leaf dry mass per aboveground dry mass ratio, it specifically focuses on the leaves of the plant, which are crucial for photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen, using chlorophyll in the leaves. Therefore, the amount of dry mass in the leaves is directly related to the plant's ability to produce energy and grow. By comparing the leaf dry mass to the total aboveground dry mass, we can assess how efficiently a plant is allocating resources to its leaves for photosynthesis. A higher leaf dry mass per aboveground dry mass ratio indicates that a larger proportion of the plant's resources are being allocated to leaf production. This suggests a higher potential for photosynthetic activity and, subsequently, the plant's overall growth and yield. Understanding this variable is crucial for agronomists and researchers as it provides insights into the plant's physiological and metabolic processes. It helps in identifying the efficiency of resource allocation within the plant and how it affects overall plant performance, crop productivity, and resilience to environmental stresses.

Aboveground humidity refers to the amount of water vapor present in the air immediately above the ground surface. It is an important factor to consider in agriculture, as it directly affects plant growth and development. This variable is influenced by a combination of factors including temperature, wind speed, and the availability of water sources. One of the primary functions of aboveground humidity is regulating the rate of transpiration in plants. Transpiration is the process by which water is lost from plant leaves through small pores called stomata. When humidity is high, the air is already saturated with moisture, making it more difficult for plants to release water vapor into the environment. As a result, transpiration rates are reduced, which can lead to water stress in plants. On the other hand, low aboveground humidity allows plants to release water vapor more easily, resulting in higher transpiration rates. This can be beneficial as it helps plants cool down and regulate their temperature. However, excessive transpiration due to low humidity can also lead to excessive water loss and dehydration in plants, especially in arid or semi-arid regions. Aboveground humidity also plays a crucial role in the spread of fungal diseases in crops. High humidity levels create an ideal environment for fungal spores to germinate and reproduce. This increases the risk of diseases such as powdery mildew, leaf spot, and rust, which can negatively impact crop yield and quality. Managing aboveground humidity through proper irrigation and ventilation techniques can help reduce the risk of fungal diseases and promote plant health. In addition to its direct impact on plants, aboveground humidity also affects insect populations. Some insects, particularly pests, prefer humid conditions and thrive in environments with high humidity levels. By understanding and monitoring aboveground humidity, farmers can implement appropriate pest management strategies to control insect populations and minimize crop damage. Monitoring aboveground humidity levels is crucial for efficient irrigation management. It helps farmers determine when and how much to irrigate, ensuring that crops receive the right amount of water for optimal growth and minimizing water waste. High humidity levels may reduce the amount of supplemental irrigation needed, while low humidity levels may require additional irrigation to prevent water stress. In conclusion, aboveground humidity is a critical variable in agriculture that influences plant transpiration, disease spread, insect populations, and irrigation management. By closely monitoring and managing aboveground humidity, farmers can optimize crop growth, reduce the risk of diseases and pests, and improve overall agricultural productivity. 

Aboveground dry mass refers to the weight of the plant's tissues that are located above the ground, excluding the roots. It is an essential parameter used in agronomy to measure the biomass and productivity of crops, including sugarcane and other plants. The aboveground dry mass is a significant indicator of the plant's growth and development and is often used as a measure of plant health and productivity. It represents the accumulation of carbohydrates and other organic materials produced by the plant through photosynthesis. This biomass is crucial for the plant's survival, as it provides energy and nutrients for various physiological processes such as respiration, growth, and reproduction. Measuring the aboveground dry mass involves harvesting the plant's aboveground parts and drying them to remove all moisture content. The dried plant material is then weighed using a balance. Determining the aboveground dry mass allows agronomists and researchers to assess the biomass production of a crop, compare different varieties or treatments, and evaluate the efficiency of agricultural practices. The aboveground dry mass is influenced by several factors, including genetic factors, environmental conditions, and cultural practices. Variations in these factors can significantly impact the growth and development of plants and, consequently, their biomass production. For example, ample sunlight, adequate water availability, and optimal nutrient supply can promote higher aboveground dry mass. Furthermore, the aboveground dry mass can vary throughout the plant's life cycle. During the early stages of growth, vigorous vegetative growth leads to an increase in aboveground dry mass. As the crop matures, the rate of biomass accumulation may slow down, and the allocation of resources may shift towards reproductive structures such as flowers and fruits. Therefore, the aboveground dry mass can be used to monitor the growth progress and stage of crop development. In the case of sugarcane, measuring the aboveground dry mass is particularly important. Sugarcane is a high-biomass crop with significant economic importance for sugar and biofuel production. Assessing the aboveground dry mass allows agronomists to estimate the potential yield of sugarcane and monitor the success of different management strategies. It also provides valuable information for sustainable intensification practices, as high aboveground dry mass is usually associated with increased photosynthetic capacity and carbon sequestration potential. In conclusion, aboveground dry mass is a crucial variable in agronomy, particularly for assessing the biomass production and productivity of crops like sugarcane. Understanding the factors influencing aboveground dry mass can help optimize agricultural practices, improve crop management 

The variable "Leaf dry mass per aboveground dry mass" is a measurement used in agronomy to evaluate the efficiency of a plant's photosynthetic process and its overall productivity. It refers to the ratio between the dry mass of the leaves and the total dry mass of the aboveground parts of a plant, such as the stem, branches, and reproductive structures. The dry mass of a plant is the weight of the plant tissues after removing all the water content. By measuring the dry mass, we can assess the amount of biomass that the plant has accumulated and use it as an indicator of its growth and development. The leaf dry mass is specifically the weight of the plant's leaves after they have been dried. Leaves are crucial for a plant's photosynthetic activity as they contain chlorophyll, the pigment responsible for capturing light energy and converting it into chemical energy. Therefore, the leaf dry mass is directly related to the plant's photosynthetic capacity and its ability to produce energy through photosynthesis. The aboveground dry mass, on the other hand, encompasses all the non-root parts of the plant that are above the ground. This includes the stems, branches, flowers, fruits, and any other reproductive structures. The aboveground dry mass represents the overall biomass of the plant, including both structural components and reproductive organs. The ratio between leaf dry mass and aboveground dry mass provides valuable information about the plant's resource allocation and its metabolic efficiency. A higher leaf dry mass per aboveground dry mass ratio indicates that the plant is investing more resources in leaf production relative to other aboveground structures. This can be advantageous in situations where plants need to maximize photosynthetic capacity, such as in high light environments or when competing for light with neighboring plants. On the other hand, a lower leaf dry mass per aboveground dry mass ratio may suggest that the plant is allocating more resources to other aboveground structures, such as stems or reproductive organs. This allocation strategy might be beneficial in conditions where plants need to prioritize growth, reproductive output, or withstand environmental stresses. Measuring leaf dry mass per aboveground dry mass can help agronomists and researchers make informed decisions regarding plant management and breeding programs. For example, it can be used to compare the productivity and resource-use efficiency of different crop varieties or to assess the impact of environmental factors, such as nutrient availability or water stress, on plant growth and development. Overall, the leaf dry mass per aboveground dry mass ratio is a critical parameter in understanding plant productivity 

Aboveground humidity refers to the amount of moisture present in the air above the ground surface. It is a vital environmental factor that directly impacts the growth and development of various crops, including sugarcane. Humidity is a measure of the water vapor content in the air. As temperature rises, the air has the ability to hold more water vapor, thus increasing humidity levels. The relationship between temperature and humidity is crucial in understanding the behavior of moisture in the atmosphere. For plants like sugarcane, aboveground humidity plays a significant role in their physiological processes. As they are tropical crops, they thrive in warm and humid conditions. Moderate to high levels of humidity in the air are ideal for their growth. This is because high humidity reduces the rate of evapotranspiration, which is the combined loss of water through plant transpiration and evaporation from the soil surface. Reduced evapotranspiration ensures that the plant has enough water to support its metabolic activities and overall growth. Additionally, high humidity levels help in maintaining proper leaf hydration. The stomata, tiny pores found on the surface of leaves, regulate the exchange of gases such as carbon dioxide and oxygen. They also control the transpiration process by opening and closing. In humid conditions, the stomata do not need to open as wide to allow for gas exchange, thus reducing water loss through transpiration. This, in turn, improves the plant's water-use efficiency and conserves moisture. Aboveground humidity also influences disease incidence and development in crops. Many fungal and bacterial pathogens thrive in humid environments. High humidity promotes the growth and spread of these pathogens, increasing the likelihood of infections in plants. Therefore, monitoring and managing aboveground humidity is crucial in preventing plant diseases and ensuring crop health. To maintain optimal aboveground humidity levels, various practices can be employed. Proper irrigation systems can help in providing the necessary moisture to the plants while avoiding waterlogging, which can lead to excessive humidity. Strategic placement of crops and intercropping can also help create microclimates that optimize humidity levels for specific crops. Additionally, monitoring weather forecasts and adjusting cultural practices accordingly can aid in managing aboveground humidity. In summary, aboveground humidity is a critical factor that directly impacts the growth, development, and overall health of crops like sugarcane. It influences various physiological processes, such as transpiration and disease incidence. By understanding and managing aboveground humidity levels, agronomists and farmers can create a conducive environment for crop growth and mitigate the risks associated with excessive or 

Cover crop coverage in percentage refers to the amount of ground area covered by cover crops, expressed as a percentage of the total field area. Cover crops are plants that are specifically grown to protect and improve the soil in between main cash crop seasons. They are usually sown after the harvest of one crop and before the planting of the next, effectively covering the soil surface. The percentage of cover crop coverage is an important measure in agriculture as it indicates the extent to which the soil is physically covered and protected. A higher percentage of cover crop coverage implies more soil surface is shielded from erosion, moisture loss, and weed growth. This coverage can greatly contribute to soil health and overall sustainability of the farming system. There are several benefits associated with maintaining higher cover crop coverage percentages. Firstly, cover crops help prevent soil erosion by acting as a physical barrier against wind and water. Their roots hold the soil particles together, reducing the risk of topsoil depletion and maintaining its integrity. This is particularly important in areas with sloping terrain or prone to heavy rainfall events. By shielding the soil, cover crops also reduce nutrient runoff and contribute to better water quality. Secondly, cover crop coverage promotes moisture conservation. The leaves and stems of cover crops create a microclimate that reduces direct sunlight exposure and slows down evaporation, thereby retaining soil moisture. This is particularly beneficial in regions with limited water resources or during periods of drought. The retained moisture can also promote beneficial microbial activity in the soil and improve nutrient availability for subsequent crops. Another advantage of maintaining high cover crop coverage percentages is weed suppression. Cover crops compete with weeds for sunlight, water, and nutrients, thereby minimizing weed growth. By shading the soil surface and inhibiting weed germination, cover crops reduce the need for herbicides and manual weed control measures. This can significantly decrease the overall cost of weed management and improve the weed-free status of subsequent cash crops. Furthermore, cover crop coverage helps enhance soil fertility and nutrient cycling. Many cover crops, such as legumes, have nitrogen-fixing abilities, which means they can capture atmospheric nitrogen and convert it into a form usable by plants. When these cover crops are incorporated into the soil, they release nitrogen and other essential nutrients, thereby replenishing the nutrient content. Additionally, the decomposition of cover crop residues enriches the organic matter content of the soil, which promotes soil structure and fertility. In summary, cover crop coverage in percentage is a valuable measure in agriculture. It quantifies the extent to which cover crops are effectively 

Ground cover by the plant refers to the extent to which the ground is covered by the canopy or foliage of the plants in a given area. It is an important parameter in agroecosystems, particularly in relation to crops like sugarcane and other plants grown for their commercial value. Ground cover by the plant serves several key functions in the growth and development of crops. Firstly, it helps to conserve moisture in the soil by reducing evaporation. When the ground is fully covered by the canopy of plants, it creates a microclimate that reduces water loss from the soil surface. This is especially crucial in areas with limited water resources or during periods of drought, as it helps to maintain optimal soil moisture levels for plant growth and development. Secondly, ground cover by the plant plays a vital role in weed suppression. When the soil surface is effectively covered by the canopy, it limits the amount of sunlight reaching the ground, making it difficult for weed seeds to germinate and grow. This reduces the competition for resources, such as water, nutrients, and sunlight, between the desired crop and weeds. By minimizing weed growth, ground cover by the plant helps to maximize the yield potential of the crops and reduces the need for herbicides or manual weed control efforts. Furthermore, ground cover by the plant provides protection against soil erosion. The roots of the plants hold the soil particles together, preventing them from being washed away by rainfall or strong winds. This is particularly important in sloping or vulnerable areas where erosion can lead to loss of topsoil, nutrients, and reduced soil fertility. Ground cover by the plant acts as a natural barrier, stabilizing the soil and reducing the risk of erosion. In addition to its practical benefits, ground cover by the plant also has positive environmental impacts. It plays a significant role in carbon sequestration, as plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during photosynthesis and store it in their biomass and in the soil. This helps in mitigating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting soil health. Furthermore, ground cover by the plant provides habitat and shelter for beneficial insects, birds, and other wildlife, contributing to biodiversity conservation and ecological balance in agricultural landscapes. Monitoring and managing ground cover by the plant are critical for optimizing crop production and sustainable farming practices. It can be assessed using remote sensing techniques, aerial imagery, or ground-based measurements. By analyzing the ground cover data, farmers and agronomists can make informed decisions regarding irrigation, fertilization, and crop protection strategies.

Different sugarcane varieties have varying growth habits, disease resistance, and yield potential. The selection of appropriate varieties based on local conditions, market demand, and desired traits can significantly impact the cane yield at harvest. In conclusion, the expected cane yield at harvest is a complex variable influenced by soil fertility, climate conditions, pest and disease pressure, crop management practices, and variety selection. Agronomists 

The number of fertilisation applications refers to the frequency with which a farmer or agronomist applies fertilizer to a crop, such as sugarcane or other plants. Fertilization is the process of adding essential nutrients to the soil to promote healthy plant growth and maximize yields. These nutrients are typically in the form of chemical elements, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are essential for the plant's metabolic functions. The quantity of elements applied can be done in one or several times, depending on the specific needs of the crop and the soil conditions. Typically, farmers will conduct soil tests to determine the nutrient levels and deficiencies in the soil. Based on these test results and the crop's nutrient requirements, they can then determine the appropriate amount and type of fertilizer to apply. The frequency of fertilisation applications depends on various factors, including the crop's growth stage, nutrient requirements, soil type, climate, and the type of fertilizer used. Different crops have different needs for nutrients and may require fertilization at various stages of their growth cycle. For instance, sugarcane has specific nutrient requirements during its growth stages, such as tillering, stem elongation, and ripening. Hence, fertilisation applications should be timed accordingly to meet these specific nutrient demands and support optimal growth and productivity. The quantity of elements applied can be done in one or several times to ensure that the crop receives an adequate supply of nutrients throughout the growing season. Some farmers prefer to apply all the required fertilizer in a single application at the beginning of the season. This approach is known as basal or pre-planting fertilization. It provides the crop with a sufficient nutrient base from the start and allows for the gradual release of nutrients into the soil as the plants grow. Alternatively, split application of fertilizer can be done in multiple times, which involves dividing the total quantity of nutrients into two or more applications throughout the growing season. This method allows for more precise nutrient management, as it provides the crop with a targeted supply of nutrients at different growth stages when they are most needed. For example, sugarcane farmers may apply a portion of the nitrogen fertilizer during the early growth stages to support tillering and leaf development. Then, additional applications can be made during stem elongation and ripening stages to meet the crop's increasing nutrient demands. The number of fertilisation applications should be carefully determined based on the crop's nutrient requirements, soil conditions, and the efficacy of the chosen fertilizer. It is important to strike a balance 

The quantity of nitrogen provided by the mineral fertiliser is a crucial factor in agricultural practices, specifically in the cultivation of crops like sugarcane. Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plant growth and development, playing a critical role in the formation of proteins, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll. It is an essential component of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. Mineral fertilisers are synthetic compounds that contain different forms of nitrogen, such as ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), and urea. These fertilisers are applied to the soil to supplement or replenish the available nitrogen levels for the plant to utilize. The quantity of nitrogen provided by the fertiliser is an important consideration because it directly impacts the crop's overall growth, yield, and quality. Determining the appropriate quantity of nitrogen to apply is a complex process that requires a comprehensive understanding of the crop's nutrient requirements, soil fertility, and environmental factors. It is essential to strike a balance between providing enough nitrogen for optimal growth without overloading the soil or causing environmental problems such as nutrient leaching or greenhouse gas emissions. The quantity of nitrogen needed for a particular crop can vary based on various factors, including the developmental stage, crop variety, soil type, and climate conditions. For example, during the initial stages of crop growth, when the demand for nitrogen is relatively low, a lower quantity of fertiliser may be sufficient. However, during the peak growth phase or when the crop is forming reproductive structures, such as flowers or fruits, the demand for nitrogen may increase significantly, requiring a higher quantity of fertiliser application. Fertiliser recommendations are often based on extensive research trials and guidelines provided by agricultural institutions or agronomic experts. These recommendations consider the crop's nitrogen uptake efficiency, which is the ability of the plant to absorb and utilize the nitrogen from the fertiliser. Improving nitrogen use efficiency is critical to optimize nutrient uptake, minimize losses, and enhance the sustainability of agricultural systems. The goal is to ensure that the quantity of nitrogen provided matches the crop's actual requirement to minimize environmental impact and economic costs. To determine the quantity of nitrogen provided by the mineral fertiliser, various methods can be used, such as soil tests, plant tissue analysis, or nitrogen budgeting. Soil testing helps assess the existing nitrogen levels in the soil and guides the decision-making process for fertiliser application rates. Plant tissue analysis involves sampling and analyzing the nutrient content in plant tissues to detect any deficiencies or im 

The quantity of P205 provided by the mineral fertilizer refers to the amount of phosphorus pentoxide (P205) available in the fertilizer that is used to supply phosphorus to crops. Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for plant growth and development, playing a vital role in various physiological processes such as energy transfer, cell division, and the formation of DNA. The mineral fertilizers used in agriculture typically contain a combination of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) known as NPK fertilizers. These fertilizers are formulated to provide plants with the necessary macronutrients required for their optimal growth and productivity. Phosphorus, represented as P205, is the source of phosphorus in mineral fertilizers. The quantity of P205 supplied by the fertilizer is expressed in terms of the percentage or weight of P205 present in the fertilizer. For instance, a 10-20-10 fertilizer means that it contains 10% nitrogen, 20% phosphorus (as P205), and 10% potassium (as K2O). The specific quantity of P205 required by crops can vary depending on various factors such as crop type, growth stage, soil phosphorus levels, and yield goals. Different crops have different phosphorus requirements, with some requiring higher levels than others. For example, phosphorus-demanding crops like sugarcane and potatoes typically require higher amounts of P205 compared to crops like corn or soybeans. The availability of phosphorus in the soil is another important factor that affects the quantity of P205 required from mineral fertilizers. Phosphorus can become locked up or fixed in the soil, making it less available for plants to uptake. In such cases, more P205 may be needed from the fertilizer to meet the crop's phosphorus requirements. The quantity of P205 provided by the mineral fertilizer should be carefully determined based on soil testing and nutrient management practices. Soil testing is essential to assess the existing phosphorus levels in the soil and to calculate the appropriate amount of P205 needed to meet the crop's requirements. Nutrient management practices, such as applying fertilizers at the right time and in the right manner, can also help optimize the utilization of phosphorus and minimize environmental losses. However, it is important to note that excessive or improper application of mineral fertilizers containing high levels of P205 can lead to environmental concerns such as water pollution, particularly in areas prone to runoff or leaching. Therefore, it is vital to follow recommended 

The variable "Quantity of K20 provided by the mineral fertiliser" refers to the amount of potassium oxide (K20) that is supplied to plants through the use of mineral fertilisers.

Mineral fertilisers are commonly used in agriculture to supplement the nutrient requirements of crops. These fertilisers often contain a blend of different elements, including potassium. The quantity of K20 provided by the mineral fertiliser is measured in terms of the weight or concentration of potassium oxide per unit area or volume. Potassium is one of the three macronutrients needed in large quantities by plants, along with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). It is classified as a macronutrient because plants require relatively large amounts of potassium compared to micronutrients. Potassium is involved in numerous vital functions within plants, such as the regulation of water balance, activation of enzymes, and protein synthesis. The quantity of K20 provided by mineral fertilisers can vary depending on several factors, including the specific formulation of the fertiliser, the desired nutrient content, and the target crop. Fertiliser recommendations are often based on soil testing and analysis to determine the nutrient deficiencies and requirements of the crop. This analysis considers factors such as soil type, pH, organic matter content, and the crop's specific nutrient demands. The availability and uptake of potassium by plants are influenced by various soil properties. For example, clay soils tend to retain more potassium than sandy soils, making it more difficult for plants to access the nutrient. Soil pH also affects the availability of potassium, with acidic soils typically having higher concentrations of available potassium. Proper management of potassium fertilisation is crucial for optimizing crop yields and quality. Insufficient potassium can lead to various deficiencies in plants, resulting in stunted growth, reduced yield, and increased susceptibility to diseases and pests. On the other hand, excessive potassium can cause nutrient imbalances and negative effects on the absorption of other nutrients. To determine the appropriate quantity of K20 to be applied through mineral fertilisers, it is essential to consider the nutrient requirements of the specific crop and the existing nutrient levels in the soil. This information can be obtained through soil testing and analysis conducted by agronomists or soil testing laboratories. Based on these results, fertiliser recommendations can be made to ensure that crops receive an optimal supply of potassium and other essential nutrients. In conclusion, the quantity of 

The variable "Quantity of liming amendment applied" refers to the amount of an amendment, typically calcium carbonate or agricultural lime, that is applied to soils in order to raise the pH level or reduce soil acidity. Liming amendment is commonly used in agriculture to improve soil fertility, nutrient availability, and microbial activity, particularly in crops like sugarcane.

Cation exchange capacity (CEC) is a fundamental concept in soil science and agriculture that refers to the ability of a soil to retain and exchange cations. Cations are positively charged ions, such as calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), potassium (K+), and sodium (Na+), which are essential nutrients for plant growth and development. The CEC of a soil is determined by the presence and concentration of clay minerals, organic matter, and soil pH. The clay minerals found in a soil play a crucial role in CEC. These minerals have a high surface area and carry a negative charge. This negative charge attracts and holds cations, preventing them from being leached away by rainfall or irrigation. Soils with a higher clay content generally have a higher CEC because they have more sites available for cation adsorption. Organic matter also greatly influences CEC. Organic matter consists of decomposed plant and animal residues and is a rich source of negatively charged functional groups. These groups attract and retain cations, increasing the soil's CEC. Soils with a higher organic matter content tend to have a higher CEC and are able to hold onto more nutrients for plant uptake. Soil pH is another important factor affecting CEC. The pH level determines the number of active sites in the soil that can adsorb cations. Soils with a higher pH (alkaline) tend to have a higher CEC because there are more negatively charged sites available for cation exchange. Conversely, acidic soils (lower pH) have fewer active sites and, therefore, a lower CEC. The cations held by the soil through CEC are not permanently fixed. They can be exchanged with other cations in the soil solution when the concentration of the exchanged cation is higher. This cation exchange process allows plants to take up essential nutrients from the soil by replacing cations on the soil particles with their root's H+ ions, thus making the nutrients available for uptake. Understanding the CEC of a soil is vital for agronomists, farmers, and soil scientists as it influences nutrient availability, nutrient retention, and soil fertility. Soils with a high CEC have the ability to retain nutrients, reducing the likelihood of nutrient leaching below the root zone. However, high CEC soils are also prone to nutrient imbalances if not properly managed. Soils with low CEC, on the other hand, have limited nutrient-holding capacity and are 

Exchangeable calcium refers to the amount of calcium present in the soil that is readily available for plant uptake. Calcium is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and plays a crucial role in various physiological processes. It is required for cell wall formation, root development, enzymatic activities, and protection against diseases. Exchangeable calcium is measured in milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) or parts per million (ppm) and represents the calcium ions bound to the exchange sites on the soil colloids. These exchange sites are negatively charged and attract positively charged ions, such as calcium, potassium, and magnesium. However, the availability of exchangeable calcium to plants is influenced by several factors, including soil pH, organic matter content, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and the presence of other cations. Soil pH plays a significant role in exchangeable calcium levels. Calcium becomes more available to plants in slightly acidic to neutral pH ranges. In highly acidic soils, the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) becomes higher, which can displace calcium ions from exchange sites, leading to calcium deficiency in plants. Conversely, in alkaline soils, calcium may become less available due to competition with other cations, such as sodium. The organic matter content in the soil also affects exchangeable calcium levels. Organic matter acts as a reservoir for calcium, as it has a high affinity for calcium ions. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to have higher exchangeable calcium levels, as the organic matter releases calcium slowly over time. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) is another factor that affects exchangeable calcium. Soils with higher CEC have a greater capacity to retain and exchange cations, including calcium. Therefore, soils with high CEC usually have higher levels of exchangeable calcium. The presence of other cations, such as potassium and magnesium, can also influence the availability of exchangeable calcium. Excessive amounts of these cations can compete with calcium for exchange sites, potentially reducing the availability of exchangeable calcium to plants. Monitoring and maintaining adequate levels of exchangeable calcium in the soil is crucial for ensuring optimal plant growth and yield. Calcium deficiency can lead to various physiological disorders in plants, such as blossom end rot in tomatoes and bitter pit in apples. Therefore, it is essential to regularly test soil for exchangeable calcium levels and make appropriate amendments if necessary. Calcium can be added to the soil through the application of lime, which raises the soil pH and increases the availability of exchangeable 

Exchangeable potassium refers to the amount of potassium (K) that is readily available for uptake by plants in the soil. It is an essential macronutrient required by plants for various physiological processes, including water and nutrient uptake, enzyme activation, and protein synthesis. In the soil, potassium exists in different forms and is present in both exchangeable and non-exchangeable pools. Exchangeable potassium is the fraction of potassium that is held in the soil solution and can easily be exchanged with other cations, such as calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), on the soil exchange sites. It is generally found in the soil's cation exchange complex, which consists of negatively charged soil particles that attract and hold positively charged nutrient ions. The quantity of exchangeable potassium in the soil is influenced by factors such as soil type, organic matter content, pH, and the amount of potassium supplied through fertilizers or previous crop residues. The availability of exchangeable potassium to plants is influenced by its concentration in the soil solution, as plants absorb nutrients from this solution through their roots. When the concentration of exchangeable potassium is low, plants may exhibit symptoms of potassium deficiency, such as stunted growth, chlorosis (yellowing) of leaves, and reduced yield. On the other hand, excessive levels of exchangeable potassium in the soil can hinder the uptake of other essential nutrients, leading to imbalances and nutrient deficiencies in plants. To ensure an optimal supply of exchangeable potassium for plant growth and development, agronomists and farmers often assess its concentration in the soil through soil testing. This allows them to determine if additional potassium fertilization is required to meet the crop's nutrient demands. They may apply potassium fertilizers, such as potassium chloride (KCl) or potassium sulfate (K2SO4), based on soil test recommendations and crop requirements. Managing exchangeable potassium levels in the soil is crucial for sustainable crop production. It is particularly important in crops like sugarcane, which have high potassium requirements to support vigorous growth and yield.

High sodium concentrations can lead to soil degradation and the development of sodic soils, which are characterized by poor water infiltration, reduced nutrient availability, and increased soil salinity. The term "exchangeable" refers to the exchange of sodium ions with other cations, such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium, on soil particles. These cations are held on the surface of clay and organic matter particles by electrostatic forces. Sodium ions can replace these essential cations, leading to an imbalance in the soil's nutrient status. This exchange capacity is influenced by various factors, including soil texture, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and the presence of sodium-bearing minerals. The measurement of exchangeable sodium is commonly performed through laboratory analysis using soil samples. The soil samples are treated with a solution containing ammonium acetate or another extractant, which replaces the sodium ions held on the soil particles. The exchanged sodium is then measured through various techniques, such as flame photometry or atomic absorption spectroscopy. Exchangeable sodium is often expressed in terms of the percentage of sodium relative to the sum of all exchangeable cations, known as the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP). A high ESP indicates a higher proportion of sodium relative to other cations, which can lead to soil degradation and reduced crop productivity. In contrast, a low ESP indicates a well-balanced cation composition, favorable for plant growth. Managing exchangeable sodium levels in the soil is crucial for sustainable crop production. Excessive sodium levels can be corrected through soil amendments and management practices such as leaching, drainage, and the addition of organic matter. These practices help to improve soil structure, enhance nutrient availability, and reduce the sodicity of the soil. In conclusion, exchangeable sodium is a critical parameter in soil fertility and crop production. Monitoring and managing exchangeable sodium levels are essential to maintain a favorable soil environment for plant growth. By understanding and implementing effective management strategies, agronomists can ensure optimal crop productivity while 

The SPAD measurement is a commonly used technique to determine the chlorophyll content in plants. SPAD stands for Soil Plant Analysis Development, and it is a non-destructive, rapid, and portable method to assess the chlorophyll levels, which can be an indicator of a plant's physiological health and photosynthetic capacity. The SPAD measurement is based on the fact that chlorophyll absorbs light in the red (650-680 nm) and infrared (930-960 nm) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The SPAD meter consists of a handheld device equipped with an LED light source that emits red light, and a sensor that measures the transmitted or reflected light. When the light passes through the plant leaves, some of it is absorbed by the chlorophyll pigments, while the rest is reflected or transmitted. To obtain a SPAD reading, the sensor is placed on the leaf surface, and the device measures the light intensity at the red wavelength. This measurement is then compared to a reference value, and the difference between the two is expressed as a SPAD value. A higher SPAD value indicates a higher chlorophyll content, while a lower value suggests lower chlorophyll concentration. The SPAD meter is particularly useful in assessing the plant's nitrogen status. Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for chlorophyll synthesis, so a plant with adequate nitrogen availability will have higher chlorophyll content and consequently a higher SPAD value. On the other hand, nitrogen-deficient plants will show lower chlorophyll levels and lower SPAD readings. The SPAD measurement is widely used in agronomy and plant physiology research as it provides a quick and reliable estimation of plant health. It allows researchers and agronomists to assess the efficiency of nutrient uptake, monitor plant responses to environmental stressors such as drought, disease, or pest infestation, and evaluate the effect of different fertilizer treatments or management practices on plant performance.

The calculation of plant growth in height per unit of time is an essential factor when studying the development of crops, such as sugarcane and other plants. This variable serves as a crucial indicator to assess plant health, productivity, and overall performance. To calculate the plant growth in height per unit of time, several key measurements are required. First, the initial height of the plant at the start of the observation period must be recorded. This initial height serves as a baseline for comparison throughout the study. Next, the final height of the plant at the end of the observation period is measured. By subtracting the initial height from the final height, we obtain the overall increase in height during that specific timeframe. To determine the growth in height per unit of time, the time elapsed between the initial and final measurements is considered. This time period is typically measured in days, weeks, or months, depending on the crop's growth rate and the duration of the study. By dividing the increase in height by the time elapsed, we can obtain the growth rate of the plant in height per specific unit of time. For instance, suppose we measure a sugarcane plant that starts at a height of 10 centimeters and after 30 days has grown to a height of 30 centimeters. The increase in height during those 30 days is 20 centimeters. Dividing this increase by the time elapsed, we find that the plant's height has grown by an average of 0.67 centimeters per day. This calculation provides valuable information about the growth dynamics of the plant. A higher growth rate indicates favorable growing conditions, such as proper nutrient availability, water supply, and sunlight exposure. Conversely, a slow or stunted growth rate may indicate suboptimal conditions or stress factors affecting the plant's development.

For example, adjustments to irrigation schedules, fertilizer application rates, or pest control measures can be implemented based on the plant's growth rate. Additionally, comparing growth rates among different cultivars or treatments can help researchers identify the most productive and resilient varieties. Furthermore, the calculation of plant growth in height per unit of time is especially relevant in crop breeding programs. Breeders aim to develop improved varieties that exhibit faster growth rates, increased plant height, and enhanced biomass accumulation. By accurately measuring and comparing growth rates, breeders can select individuals with desirable traits and incorporate them into future breeding efforts. In conclusion, 

The standard deviation of the TVD (Top of Vegetation to the Ground) height is a statistical measure used to quantify the variability or spread of the height measurements taken across a given area of sugarcane or other crops. It provides valuable insights into the uniformity or heterogeneity of the plant height distribution within a field or experimental plot. The TVD height represents the distance from the topmost part of the vegetation, typically the highest leaf, to the ground level. By calculating the standard deviation of these height measurements, agronomists can assess the extent of variation in plant height among individual plants in the same area or across different areas within a field. A low standard deviation value indicates that the TVD heights are closely clustered around the mean, suggesting a more uniform or consistent distribution of plant heights. This can be indicative of favorable growing conditions, effective crop management practices, and consistent plant growth patterns. On the other hand, a high standard deviation value suggests a greater dispersion of TVD heights, indicating a more heterogeneous or uneven distribution of plant heights across the area under study. This could be due to various factors such as variability in soil quality, nutrient availability, irrigation practices, pest or disease incidence, or even genetic variation among the plants. The standard deviation of the TVD height is a valuable tool for crop management and decision-making processes. It helps determine the effectiveness of applied agronomic practices and provides insights into potential yield variability within a field. Farmers and agronomists can use this information to identify spatial patterns in plant height and implement site-specific management strategies for optimizing crop production. Moreover, the standard deviation of the TVD height can be used to assess the performance of different cultivars or varieties within a field or experimental trial. By comparing the standard deviations among different genetic lines or treatments, agronomists can gain insights into the uniformity of plant growth and identify superior plant materials or management practices that lead to more consistent crop performance. Another benefit of considering the standard deviation of the TVD height is its relevance in precision agriculture and the use of remote sensing technologies. Remote sensing tools, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multispectral or LiDAR sensors, can provide high-resolution and spatially explicit data on plant height. By analyzing the standard deviation of TVD heights derived from remote sensing data, agronomists can identify areas of the field with higher or lower height variability, potentially indicating areas of concern or areas that require further investigation or intervention. In conclusion, the 

The variable "tvd average height" refers to the average height of a specific crop, such as sugarcane, measured using a technology called terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) or terrestrial LiDAR. TLS is a remote sensing technique that uses a laser scanner to collect precise measurements of the distance between the scanner and objects in its line of sight. For agricultural purposes, TLS is often used to gather detailed information about plant structure and growth. To measure the average height of a crop using TLS, a laser scanner is set up at a fixed location near the field. The scanner emits laser pulses that bounce off the plants and return to the scanner, providing information about the distance between the scanner and the plants.

Light is a crucial environmental factor that impacts the growth, development, and overall performance of plants. It is essential for photosynthesis, the process through which plants convert light energy into chemical energy to fuel their growth and metabolism. Light acts as a source of energy, influencing various physiological and biochemical processes in plants. It plays a vital role in regulating the plant's morphology, anatomy, and metabolism. One of the primary functions of light is to provide the energy required for photosynthesis. Plants have specialized structures called chloroplasts that contain chlorophyll, a pigment that captures light energy. This energy is then used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, contributing to the plant's growth and carbohydrate storage. Different wavelengths of light have varying energy levels and can be absorbed by specific pigments, such as chlorophylls and carotenoids. Apart from energy production, light also influences plant development and morphology. The quality, intensity, duration, and direction of light determine the plant's shape, size, leaf arrangement, branching patterns, and flowering. For example, plants grown in low light conditions may appear elongated and spindly as they stretch towards a light source, while those exposed to full sunlight tend to be more compact and bushy. Light also affects leaf coloration and pigmentation, influencing the plant's attractiveness to pollinators and its ability to protect itself from excessive light or UV radiation. Light also plays a significant role in photoperiodism, the physiological response of plants to changes in day length. It determines the timing of key developmental processes, such as flowering, dormancy, and senescence. Plants are classified as short-day, long-day, or day-neutral based on their flowering response to photoperiodic cues. These responses are crucial for reproductive success and the synchronization of plant life cycles with environmental conditions. In addition to affecting photosynthesis and plant development, light also influences plant metabolism. Light regulates the production of various hormones, including auxins, gibberellins, and cytokinins, which control growth, cell division, and the formation of lateral shoots and roots. Light intensity and the ratio of different wavelengths also influence the synthesis and distribution of secondary metabolites, such as pigments, phenolics, and essential oils, which contribute to plant defense mechanisms and characteristics like color and flavor.

The average air temperature in ° Celsius is a crucial variable when it comes to understanding the climate conditions and their impact on crops, particularly sugarcane. Temperature plays a significant role in the growth and development of sugarcane plants, as it influences various physiological processes and stages of the crop's life cycle. For starters, the average air temperature affects the germination of sugarcane seeds or the sprouting of stalks when propagated vegetatively. Sugarcane typically requires a minimum temperature of around 20-25°C for successful germination, and excessively low temperatures can hinder this process. On the other hand, extremely high temperatures can also have detrimental effects, leading to poor germination rates and weakened seedlings. Once the sugarcane plants have established, the average air temperature continues to impact their growth rate. Sugarcane is considered a warm-season crop, and it thrives in temperatures ranging from 25-35°C. The growth rate of sugarcane is closely linked to temperature, with optimal rates achieved within this range. If temperatures surpass the upper limit, particularly during the summer months, it can lead to heat stress, reduced photosynthetic activity, and ultimately decrease the overall crop yield. The average air temperature also affects the sucrose accumulation in sugarcane stalks, which is one of the crucial factors determining the crop's economic value. Generally, moderate temperatures between 20-30°C favor sucrose accumulation in sugarcane. Cooler temperatures slow down the process, while high temperatures can disrupt the balance between photosynthesis and respiration, leading to lower sucrose content in the stalks. Apart from the direct impact on sugarcane growth and development, fluctuations in the average air temperature can significantly influence pest and disease incidence.

The potassium concentration of the WAB, which stands for Water Available to the Crop, is a crucial variable with significant implications for the growth and development of sugarcane and other crops. Potassium, one of the essential macronutrients needed by plants, plays a vital role in various physiological processes and overall plant health. Potassium is involved in numerous biochemical and metabolic activities within plants. It regulates the opening and closing of stomata, the tiny pores on the surface of leaves that allow for gas exchange. This function influences the regulation of water use in plants, as well as the uptake of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. Additionally, potassium is crucial for the synthesis of proteins and the conversion of carbohydrates into energy during respiration. It also improves the efficiency of nutrient uptake by enhancing the transport of other nutrients within the plant. The concentration of potassium in the WAB is essential because it directly affects the availability of this nutrient to the crops. The WAB refers to the portion of water that can be easily accessed by plant roots, typically held in the soil between field capacity (when the soil is fully saturated) and wilting point (when the soil moisture is too low for the plant to extract water effectively). The concentration of potassium in this water directly affects the amount of available potassium that can be taken up by the roots. Consequently, an optimal potassium concentration in the WAB is crucial to ensure proper nutrition and growth of crops. A deficiency of potassium in the WAB can lead to stunted growth, reduced yield, and poor crop quality.

The sodium concentration of the WAB refers to the amount of sodium present in the water used for agricultural purposes, such as irrigation or crop spraying. Sodium is an important element in plant nutrition, but excessive levels can have detrimental effects on crop health and productivity. The presence of sodium in water sources can arise from various natural and anthropogenic factors. In certain regions, high levels of sodium can be found in water due to geological features, such as the presence of salt deposits or rock formations containing sodium minerals. Additionally, human activities such as industrial processes, agricultural runoff, or wastewater discharges can introduce sodium into water sources. When water with high sodium concentrations is used for irrigation, it can have adverse effects on soil and plant health. One of the primary concerns associated with high sodium levels is soil salinity. Sodium ions, in combination with other salts, can accumulate in the soil over time, leading to increased electrical conductivity and reduced water permeability. This can result in poor soil structure, reduced water-holding capacity, and impaired root growth. The presence of high sodium levels in irrigation water can also cause specific nutritional imbalances in plants. Sodium competes with other essential nutrients, such as potassium and calcium, for uptake by plant roots. Consequently, excessive sodium concentrations can disrupt the optimal nutrient balance in plants, leading to nutrient deficiencies or imbalances. These imbalances can negatively impact plant growth, development, and overall crop yield. Moreover, certain crops, such as sugarcane, are more sensitive to high sodium concentrations than others. Sugarcane plants tend to have a low tolerance for sodium, and its presence in irrigation water can significantly affect their growth and productivity. High sodium levels can restrict water uptake by the plants, leading to reduced leaf expansion and photosynthetic activity. This can ultimately result in decreased sugar production and overall crop quality. To mitigate the negative impacts of high sodium concentrations, various strategies can be employed.

It is a measure of the energy content and potential nutritional value of the biomass, specifically organic matter, for ruminant livestock or other animals. OMD is an important parameter to assess the feed quality and potential of various crops and agricultural residues for animal feeding. It provides valuable information about the digestibility and availability of nutrients present in the WAB, which is crucial for efficient utilization of feed resources in animal production systems. The in vitro method involves simulating the rumen environment in the laboratory, where the WAB is fermented by a mixture of rumen fluid and buffer solution. Microorganisms present in the rumen fluid are responsible for breaking down the organic matter into simpler compounds, which can then be absorbed by the animal's digestive system. The process is conducted under controlled conditions of temperature, pH, and incubation time to mimic the ruminal fermentation process. The WAB is typically processed into smaller particle sizes to ensure uniform digestion and provide accurate results. The in vitro OMD is determined by measuring the amount of gas produced during fermentation. The gas production is a result of the breakdown of organic matter and the release of fermentation byproducts such as carbon dioxide and methane. The gas production is measured using specialized equipment, and the data is used to calculate the digestibility of the WAB. Higher in vitro OMD values indicate greater digestibility and nutrient availability for animals. Crops with high OMD values are considered to be of superior quality as livestock feed, as they provide more energy per unit consumed. This information is useful for farmers, nutritionists, and researchers involved in animal feed formulation and management. The in vitro OMD of the WAB can vary depending on several factors. The composition and maturity stage of the crop, as well as any processing or treatment methods, can significantly influence the digestibility.

The calculation of the proportion of water contained in the aerial part of a plant is an essential aspect of understanding the plant's water status and its physiological processes. This variable provides valuable insights into plant health and helps agronomists make informed irrigation decisions. To begin calculating the proportion of water in the aerial part of a plant, it is crucial to measure two main components: plant biomass and plant water content. Plant biomass refers to the total dry weight of the plant's above-ground tissues, including leaves, stems, and reproductive structures. It provides an indication of the plant's overall size and productivity. To determine plant biomass, the agronomist collects a representative sample of the plant, typically by harvesting a specific number of plants or taking clippings from multiple individuals. The collected sample is then dried in an oven to remove all the water content, leaving only the dry mass. The resulting weight is used to estimate the biomass of the entire plant population. The second component needed for the calculation is the plant water content. This parameter reflects the amount of water stored within the plant's tissues. It can vary depending on several factors, including the plant species, environmental conditions, and the plant's physiological stage. Measuring plant water content commonly involves collecting fresh plant samples, preferably from the same population used for biomass determination. The fresh samples are weighed immediately after collection to record their wet weight. Subsequently, these samples are dried in an oven until no further weight loss occurs. The final dry weight is then measured, and the difference between wet and dry weights represents the plant's water content. Once plant biomass and water content are determined, the proportion of water in the aerial part of the plant can be calculated. It is computed by dividing the water content by the plant biomass and expressing it as a percentage. The formula is as follows: (Plant water content / Plant biomass) x 100 For example, if a sugarcane plant has a water content of 300 grams and a biomass of 1000 grams, the proportion of water in the aerial part of the plant can be calculated as: (300 / 1000) x 100 = 30% This result indicates that 30% of the plant's aerial biomass is composed of water. Understanding the proportion of water in the aerial part of a plant is crucial for monitoring plant water status, identifying water stress, and optimizing irrigation regimes. Plants with a lower water content may exhibit signs of dehydration and stress, while those with higher water contents may

Studies have indicated that higher temperatures and adequate rainfall promote the accumulation of sugars in sugarcane plants. Additionally, the time of harvest and maturity stage can influence the sugar concentration. Sugarcane crops are typically harvested when the sugar content is at its maximum level, ensuring the best possible sweetening performance. Agricultural practices such as fertilization, irrigation, and pest management also play a role in determining the soluble sugar concentration of the WAB. Appropriate fertilization with macro and micronutrients ensures optimal plant growth and sugar accumulation. Adequate irrigation and water management are crucial for maintaining optimal plant health and avoiding moisture stress that can reduce sugar content. Effective pest and disease management are necessary to prevent damage to the stalks and minimize sugar losses. Measuring the soluble sugar concentration of the WAB can be done through laboratory analysis techniques. The most common method is the polarimetric analysis, which utilizes a polarimeter to measure the ability of the sugarcane juice to rotate polarized light. This rotation is directly proportional to the sugar concentration in the juice. In conclusion, the soluble sugar concentration of the WAB is a critical parameter in evaluating the quality and market value of sugarcane crops. It is influenced by genetic factors, environmental conditions, and agricultural practices. Understanding and managing the sugar concentration 

The variable of "percentage of sugar of the fresh matter overground biomass" refers to the measurement or calculation of the proportion of sugar content in the above-ground parts of a plant, in relation to the total weight of those parts. This variable is commonly used in the field of agronomy, particularly in the study and cultivation of sugarcane and other crops that are valued for their sugar content. The percentage of sugar in the fresh matter overground biomass is often an important indicator for assessing the quality and economic value of a crop. In the case of sugarcane, which is primarily grown for its high sugar content, this variable is of utmost importance for predicting the yield and profitability of the crop. Farmers and agronomists use this variable to determine the optimal time for harvesting the sugarcane, as well as to make informed decisions regarding the cultivation practices and fertilizer requirements of the crop. Measuring the sugar content in the fresh matter overground biomass can be done using various methods. One common method involves taking representative samples of the plant's above-ground parts, such as the stalks or leaves, and analyzing them for their sugar composition. This can be done through laboratory tests, where the plant material is processed and the sugar content is measured using techniques like chromatography or spectrophotometry. The results are then expressed as a percentage, indicating the proportion of sugar in relation to the total weight of the fresh matter. The percentage of sugar in the fresh matter overground biomass can vary significantly depending on various factors. These factors include the specific crop variety or cultivar, the age of the plant, the growing conditions, and the management practices employed by the farmer. Generally, younger plants tend to have a higher sugar content compared to older ones, as the sugar content decreases with plant maturity. For crops other than sugarcane, such as sugar beets or sweet sorghum, this variable remains important for assessing the sugar yield per unit of biomass. It is crucial in determining the optimal stage of harvest and making decisions regarding processing and utilization of the crops. In addition, for crop breeding programs, measuring the percentage of sugar in the fresh matter overground biomass is crucial for selecting and developing varieties with higher sugar content, as it serves as a key trait in improving crop productivity and quality. In conclusion, the percentage of sugar in the fresh matter overground biomass is a valuable variable in agronomy, particularly for sugarcane and other crops with high sugar content. It allows farmers and agronomists 

The calculation of the ratio of above-ground biomass to root biomass (dry) is an important metric in evaluating the growth and productivity of plants, particularly in the case of crops like sugarcane. Above-ground biomass refers to the total weight of all the parts of a plant that are above the ground, such as leaves, stems, and reproductive structures. Root biomass, on the other hand, refers to the total weight of the plant's root system, including primary and secondary roots. To calculate the ratio of above-ground biomass to root biomass, we need to determine the dry weight of both components. This is achieved by harvesting a representative sample of the plant, separating the above-ground and root parts, and then drying them to remove any moisture content. Once the samples have been dried, their weights are measured separately using a digital balance or a similar weighing apparatus. The weights are usually recorded in grams or kilograms. To obtain an accurate representation of the plant's biomass ratio, it is important to consider both the total above-ground biomass and the total root biomass. This can be achieved by summing up the weights of all the individual plants within a sample or by extrapolating from a smaller sample to estimate the overall biomass for a larger area or population. Once the dry weights of the above-ground and root biomass are obtained, the ratio is calculated by dividing the above-ground biomass by the root biomass. This can be expressed as a decimal or a fraction. The ratio of above-ground biomass to root biomass serves as an indicator of how plants allocate their resources for growth and development. In crops like sugarcane, a higher ratio suggests that more resources are allocated to above-ground biomass, which includes the parts involved in sugar production, such as stalks and leaves. This is desirable for maximizing sugar yield. Conversely, a lower ratio may indicate that a greater proportion of resources is allocated to root growth. This can be beneficial in certain circumstances, such as promoting nutrient uptake and water absorption, which are critical for plant survival and productivity. The ratio of above-ground biomass to root biomass can vary depending on various factors including plant species, environmental conditions, and nutrient availability. It can also change throughout the growth cycle of the plant, reflecting different stages of development and resource allocation. In conclusion, the calculation of the ratio of above-ground biomass to root biomass provides valuable insights into the resource allocation and growth strategies of plants. This ratio is particularly relevant in crops like sugarcane, where a higher above-ground biomass to root biomass 

The ratio of above-ground biomass to root biomass is a measurement commonly used in agronomy to evaluate the balance between above-ground and below-ground plant components. This ratio provides valuable insights into the overall health and productivity of the crop. To calculate this ratio, the above-ground biomass and root biomass need to be measured separately. Above-ground biomass refers to the weight of all the plant parts that are visible above the ground, including leaves, stems, and reproductive structures. It can be determined by harvesting and weighing these plant parts. On the other hand, root biomass represents the weight of the plant's underground components, including the roots themselves and any associated soil. Measuring root biomass is usually more challenging than above-ground biomass due to the difficulty of accessing and separating roots from the soil without causing damage. Various techniques are employed to estimate root biomass, such as soil coring, excavation, or the use of root-specific markers. Once both above-ground and root biomasses are determined, the ratio can be calculated by dividing the above-ground biomass by the root biomass. This provides a numeric value that reflects the proportion of plant growth allocated to above-ground versus below-ground structures. The interpretation of the ratio of above-ground biomass to root biomass depends on the specific crop and management goals. Generally, a high ratio indicates that the plant has invested more resources into above-ground structures, such as leaves and stems, which are responsible for photosynthesis and energy production. This can be advantageous for crops with higher aerial biomass requirements, like cereals or forage crops, as it suggests a greater potential for photosynthetic activity and productivity. Conversely, a low ratio suggests that the plant has allocated more resources to root growth, emphasizing below-ground structures responsible for nutrient and water uptake. This can be beneficial in crops with shallow root systems or under drought conditions, as it indicates an increased ability to explore and exploit soil resources. However, it's important to note that the interpretation of this ratio should be done in conjunction with other plant growth parameters and environmental factors. Additionally, the ratio may vary throughout the plant's life cycle, depending on various factors such as developmental stage, soil conditions, and management practices. In conclusion, the calculation of the ratio of above-ground biomass to root biomass provides valuable information about the allocation of plant resources and plays a crucial role in assessing the health and productivity of crops. Agronomists and researchers can utilize this ratio to understand the plant's allocation strategy and make informed decisions regarding crop management and optimization of yield potential. 

UFL stands for Universal Forage Losses, and in the context of sugarcane and other crops, it refers to the losses that occur during the harvesting and processing of the crop. Specifically, UFL of the WAB refers to the Universal Forage Loss of the Whole Agricultural Biomass. When it comes to sugarcane and other crops, the UFL of the WAB is a crucial parameter that agronomists and farmers need to consider. It represents the amount of biomass that is lost or wasted during the various stages of cultivation, harvesting, transportation, and processing. These losses can occur due to a variety of factors such as weather conditions, improper handling, mechanical damage, fungal or pest infestations, and inefficient processing methods. Understanding and minimizing the UFL of the WAB is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it directly impacts the overall yield and productivity of the crop. Higher losses mean lower yields and consequently reduced profitability for farmers. Moreover, it puts pressure on the environment and natural resources as more inputs are needed to compensate for the losses. Reducing the UFL of the WAB requires a systematic approach and implementation of best management practices. This includes optimizing harvesting techniques, improving transportation methods, and adopting efficient processing technologies. For example, using modern harvesting machinery that minimizes mechanical damage to the crop and reduces losses during cutting can significantly decrease the UFL of the WAB. Furthermore, post-harvest management plays a critical role in minimizing losses. Proper storage facilities, appropriate handling, and prompt processing are essential to prevent spoilage, decay, and fungal or pest infestations. This can be achieved through the use of drying techniques, silage production, or ensiling methods, depending on the crop and local conditions. It is worth mentioning that reducing the UFL of the WAB not only benefits the farmers but also contributes to sustainable agriculture and resource conservation. By minimizing losses, more of the crop can be utilized for various purposes such as food, feed, fuel, or fiber. This can have positive economic and social impacts, increasing food security, supporting livestock production, and promoting rural development. In conclusion, the UFL of the WAB refers to the losses incurred during the cultivation, harvesting, transportation, and processing of sugarcane and other crops. Minimizing these losses is crucial for optimizing yield, preserving natural resources, and promoting sustainable agriculture. By adopting best management practices and efficient technologies, farmers and agronomists can reduce the UFL of the 

The frequency index of application of herbicide is a variable that quantifies the number of times herbicide is applied to a particular crop over a given period, typically expressed per unit of time (e.g., per year or per growing season). This variable is an important metric in the field of agronomy as it provides valuable insights into the intensity and efficiency of weed management practices in agricultural systems. Herbicides are chemical compounds that are specifically designed to control or eradicate unwanted plants, commonly referred to as weeds, in crop fields. These weeds compete with crops for essential resources such as sunlight, water, and nutrients, thereby adversely affecting crop growth and productivity. To mitigate these detrimental effects, herbicides are applied to selectively target and eliminate weeds, allowing crops to thrive. The frequency index of application of herbicide serves as an indicator of farmers' reliance on herbicide-based weed management strategies. A high frequency index signifies that herbicide is being applied more frequently, suggesting a greater dependency on chemical control methods. Conversely, a low frequency index indicates that herbicide application is less frequent, indicating the utilization of alternative weed management techniques or a generally low weed pressure. Several factors influence the frequency index of herbicide applications. Firstly, weed species composition and density in a particular crop field affect the need for herbicide application. If the field is heavily infested with highly competitive and resistant weed species, farmers may need to apply herbicide more frequently to effectively control weed growth. Secondly, the effectiveness and persistence of the herbicide being used can also influence the frequency index. Some herbicides have a longer residual activity, which can provide prolonged weed control, thereby reducing the need for frequent applications. On the other hand, herbicides with shorter persistence may require more frequent applications to maintain effective weed control throughout the growing season. Furthermore, the choice of crop and the cropping system employed can also impact the frequency index of herbicide applications. Certain crop species may be more competitive against weeds, reducing the need for herbicide application. Additionally, integrated weed management practices, such as crop rotation, cover cropping, and mechanical weed control, can help reduce weed pressure and subsequently lower the frequency index of herbicide applications. Monitoring and managing the frequency index of herbicide applications is crucial for sustainable and environmentally friendly crop production. Excessive and uncontrolled herbicide use can have negative consequences on human health, non-target organisms, and the environment. Therefore, agronomists and farmers must strive to optimize herbicide application by considering factors such as weed species 

The rate of increase in ground cover by the plant refers to the speed at which the plant's foliage and overall vegetation expands and spreads across the ground. It is an essential variable to consider in agriculture, particularly in the cultivation of crops like sugarcane and other plants that have a dense and extensive canopy. Ground cover plays a crucial role in agricultural systems as it helps to protect the soil from erosion, conserve moisture, regulate soil temperature, suppress weed growth, and improve nutrient cycling. The rate of increase in ground cover directly impacts these factors, making it an important consideration for agronomists and farmers alike. One key aspect of the rate of increase in ground cover is its ability to control soil erosion. A densely covered ground surface helps in reducing surface runoff and capturing rainwater, preventing soil particles from being washed away. This is particularly important in areas with sloping lands or heavy rainfall, where soil erosion can be a major concern. By reducing erosion, the ground cover helps maintain the overall health and fertility of the soil, ensuring favorable conditions for crop growth. Another benefit of a higher rate of increase in ground cover is the improved moisture retention in the soil. The plant canopy acts as a natural barrier, reducing evaporation and preserving soil moisture. This is especially relevant in arid and semi-arid regions, where water scarcity is an issue. Adequate ground cover helps increase water-use efficiency in crops, ensuring a more sustainable use of limited water resources. The rate of ground cover by the plant also affects soil temperature regulation. A thicker and denser canopy provides shade, reducing the amount of direct sunlight reaching the soil surface. This moderates soil temperatures, preventing extreme fluctuations that can be detrimental to plant growth and development. Additionally, shade from ground cover can help reduce weed competition, as many weed species require full sunlight for germination and growth. Moreover, the rate of increase in ground cover is closely related to weed suppression. A dense ground cover limits light availability for emerging weed seeds, reducing their germination and growth. This naturally occurring weed suppression helps reduce the use of herbicides and minimizes competition for resources such as water, nutrients, and light. In the case of sugarcane, a crop known for its vigorous growth and ability to form a thick canopy, a high rate of increase in ground cover is desirable. Sugarcane plants typically reach full ground coverage between 6 to 8 weeks after planting, depending on the variety and growing conditions. Achieving rapid and uniform ground cover is essential 

The leaf appearance rate per plant is a vital variable in determining the growth and development of plants, particularly in sugarcane and other crops. It is defined as the number of new leaves that emerge on a plant over a given period, usually expressed as the number of leaves per day. Leaf appearance rate serves as an essential measure of a plant's ability to photosynthesize and capture sunlight for energy production. It directly relates to the plant's ability to produce biomass and yield, making it a crucial parameter in agronomy and crop improvement programs. A high leaf appearance rate is generally considered desirable as it indicates a rapid and vigorous plant growth. This is particularly important in crops like sugarcane, where the accumulation of photosynthetic biomass is vital for sugar production. In such crops, a high leaf appearance rate ensures an increased leaf area for capturing solar radiation, enhancing the photosynthetic capacity of the crop and ultimately influencing its yield potential. Different factors can influence the leaf appearance rate per plant. Environmental factors such as temperature, light intensity, and water availability play a significant role in determining the rate at which new leaves emerge. For instance, warmer temperatures typically accelerate leaf emergence, while extended periods of low light intensity or water stress can slow down leaf development. Genetic factors also heavily influence the leaf appearance rate. Plant breeders and geneticists focus on improving this trait by selecting and developing cultivars that exhibit a higher rate of leaf emergence. Through selective breeding, plants with desirable leaf appearance characteristics can be developed, leading to improved yields and more robust crops. Leaf appearance rate varies between different crop species, with each having its own optimal growth rate. For instance, some fast-growing crops like corn or lettuce have a higher leaf appearance rate compared to slower-growing crops like trees or perennial grasses. Understanding the specific leaf appearance rate requirements of different crops enables agronomists to optimize management practices and facilitate more effective crop production. Monitoring the leaf appearance rate per plant can be accomplished through regular field observations, where the number of new leaves emerging from individual plants is counted over a specified period. This information can then be used to assess the growth and development of crops, detect any abnormalities or stress factors, and make informed decisions regarding nutrient management, irrigation scheduling, and pest and disease control. In conclusion, the leaf appearance rate per plant is an important agronomic variable that influences the growth, productivity, and overall performance of crops like sugarcane and others. A high leaf appearance rate ensures a vigorous plant growth, increased photos 

The Index of weed control efficiency based on weed ground cover is a measure used in agronomy to assess the effectiveness of weed control methods in agricultural fields, particularly in relation to sugarcane and other crops. Weeds are undesirable plants that compete with cultivated plants for resources such as nutrients, water, and light. They can severely impact crop yields and quality if left uncontrolled. The index is calculated by comparing the amount of weed ground cover in a treated area to the amount of weed ground cover in an untreated or uncontrolled area. The measurements are typically conducted before and after a weed control method is applied, such as herbicide application or mechanical cultivation. By measuring the percentage of the field covered by weeds in both scenarios, the percentage of weed control can be determined. The higher the index value, the more effective the weed control method was in reducing weed ground cover. For example, an index value of 90% would indicate that the control method reduced weed ground cover by 90% compared to the uncontrolled area. Conversely, a lower index value suggests that the control method was less effective in reducing weed ground cover. This index is valuable for agronomists and farmers as it allows them to quantitatively evaluate the performance of different weed control strategies and select the most efficient method for weed management. It helps in making informed decisions regarding weed control practices, optimizing resource allocation, and maximizing crop productivity. The index is influenced by several factors, including the type of weed species present, the timing and frequency of weed control interventions, and the specific control method employed. Different weed species vary in terms of growth rates, reproductive strategies, and tolerance to control methods. Therefore, the index can provide insights into which types of weeds are most effectively controlled by specific methods. Additionally, the index can help identify potential issues or shortcomings in weed control measures. If the index value is significantly lower than anticipated or desired, it may indicate the need for adjustments in the control strategy or the introduction of alternative methods to improve weed management. Monitoring the index over time can also help ascertain the long-term efficacy of control methods and detect any potential shifts in weed species composition or resistance development. In conclusion, the Index of weed control efficiency based on weed ground cover is a crucial tool in evaluating the performance of weed control methods in agricultural fields. It provides a quantitative measure of weed suppression and helps agronomists and farmers make informed decisions about weed management practices. By utilizing this index, the agricultural community can optimize weed control strategies and maximize crop productivity 

The Index of weed control efficiency based on weed dry mass is a measure used in agronomy to assess the effectiveness of weed control methods in managing weed populations in crop fields. Weeds pose a significant threat to crop production as they compete with crops for nutrients, water, and sunlight, leading to yield losses and reduced crop quality. Therefore, it is crucial for agronomists and farmers to find effective ways to control weeds and minimize their impact. This index is calculated by comparing the dry mass of weeds in a treated plot (where weed control measures were applied) with the dry mass of weeds in an untreated control plot (where no weed control measures were applied). The dry mass of weeds in each plot is determined by harvesting all the weeds present, drying them, and weighing them. The percentage reduction in weed dry mass in the treated plot compared to the control plot is then calculated. The index provides a quantitative measure of how well a particular weed control method or treatment has performed in reducing weed biomass. A higher index value indicates greater weed control efficiency and a more significant reduction in weed dry mass, while a lower index value indicates lesser effectiveness in managing weeds. The evaluation of weed control efficiency based on weed dry mass is valuable for several reasons. Firstly, it allows agronomists and farmers to compare the effectiveness of different weed control methods or treatments. This information can help them make informed decisions about which approach to use in their fields. Secondly, it provides a standardized measure that allows for comparisons across different studies and locations, facilitating the exchange of knowledge and best practices in weed management. It is essential to consider that the index of weed control efficiency based on weed dry mass is just one component of overall weed management. Other factors such as the impact on crop yield, cost-effectiveness, environmental impact, and ease of implementation should also be taken into account when selecting weed control strategies. Additionally, weed populations can vary in their response to different control methods, and some species may be more resilient or challenging to control than others. In conclusion, the Index of weed control efficiency based on weed dry mass is a valuable tool for assessing and quantifying the effectiveness of weed control methods. By providing a standardized measure of weed management, it helps agronomists and farmers make informed decisions about weed control strategies. However, it should be used in conjunction with other factors and considerations to develop comprehensive and effective weed management programs. 

The variable "number of days to reach 50% of seed emergence in days since sowing" refers to the time it takes for half of the seeds to begin sprouting after being planted in the soil. This variable is crucial in determining the germination and emergence performance of seeds, particularly in crops like sugarcane, where successful germination is essential for a good crop stand and yield. When seeds are sown, they go through a process known as germination, where they absorb water and initiate the growth of a new plant. The number of days to reach 50% seed emergence is a measure of how quickly this process occurs. It indicates how long it takes for half of the planted seeds to break through the soil surface and become visible as seedlings. Several factors can affect the number of days to reach 50% seed emergence. Soil temperature, moisture, seed quality, and planting depth are some of the key factors that influence germination speed. Seeds will germinate faster in warm, moist soil conditions, as this provides an ideal environment for the seeds to take in water and initiate growth. Conversely, if the soil is too cold or dry, the germination process may be delayed, leading to a longer time to reach 50% seed emergence. Seed quality is also an important factor. High-quality seeds that are genetically viable and free from disease or abnormalities will generally germinate more uniformly and at a faster rate compared to poor-quality seeds. Additionally, the depth at which the seeds are planted can impact germination time. Planting seeds too deep may delay emergence, as it takes longer for the seedling to reach the soil surface. The number of days to reach 50% seed emergence is a valuable metric for farmers and agronomists as it helps determine the success of a crop stand. A uniform and timely emergence is crucial for establishing a dense and even crop, which improves competition with weeds and maximizes yield potential. In crops like sugarcane, where fields are often harvested mechanically, an even and synchronized crop stand is essential for efficient harvest operations. Moreover, knowledge of the germination rate and time to reach 50% seed emergence allows farmers to plan and adjust their planting schedules. They can optimize the timing of planting based on the desired crop growth stages, climatic conditions, and potential disease and pest pressures in order to maximize yield and minimize risks. In conclusion, the number of days to reach 50% of seed emergence is a fundamental variable in understanding the ger

Monitoring the manganese content in plant leaves is crucial for assessing the nutritional status of the crops. Leaf tissue analysis is commonly used to diagnose deficiencies or excesses of various nutrients, including manganese. By analyzing the manganese content in leaves, agronomists and farmers can determine if the plants are receiving an adequate supply of this essential element. This information then helps in making necessary adjustments to fertilizer applications or soil management practices to maintain optimal manganese levels and enhance crop productivity. In conclusion, manganese content in the leaves is a vital variable that agronomists consider when studying the health and productivity of crops, specifically sugarcane. Manganese is essential for efficient photosynthesis, enzyme activation, and nutrient uptake within plants. Monitoring and maintaining optimal manganese levels in leaves are crucial for ensuring proper 

The carbon content in the leaves refers to the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) that plants absorb from the atmosphere and convert into carbon compounds through the process of photosynthesis. Carbon is a crucial element for plant growth and development, and it plays a vital role in the overall health and productivity of plants. Leaves are the primary site of photosynthesis, where plants capture sunlight energy and convert it into chemical energy through the synthesis of glucose and other organic compounds. During photosynthesis, plants absorb CO2 from the atmosphere through tiny openings called stomata on the leaf surface. Inside the leaf, the CO2 is then used in conjunction with water and sunlight to produce sugars and other essential organic molecules. The carbon derived from CO2 forms the backbone of these carbon-based compounds. The carbon content in the leaves varies among different plant species, and it can also vary within a single plant depending on factors such as age, environmental conditions, and nutrient availability. Generally, plants with higher carbon content in their leaves tend to be more vigorous and productive. This is because an abundance of carbon allows plants to synthesize more sugars, which can be used for energy production, growth, and reproduction. The carbon content in leaves is not only important for plant growth but also for the environment. Plants act as carbon sinks, absorbing significant amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere and storing it as carbon in their tissues, including leaves. This process helps mitigate the greenhouse effect and reduce the overall concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, which is a primary contributor to climate change. In addition to its role in photosynthesis and carbon storage, the carbon content in leaves can provide valuable information about the nutritional status of plants and the overall health of agricultural systems. Imbalances in carbon content can indicate nutrient deficiencies or other stressors that affect plant metabolism. For example, low carbon content in leaves may indicate a lack of nitrogen, which is an essential nutrient for photosynthesis and overall plant growth. Monitoring the carbon content in leaves can, therefore, help agronomists and farmers assess plant nutrient status and make informed decisions regarding fertilization and other management practices. In summary, the carbon content in leaves is a critical parameter that determines plant productivity, contributes to carbon sequestration, and provides insights into plant nutrient status. Understanding and managing carbon content in leaves can enhance crop yields, mitigate climate change, and improve the overall health and sustainability of agricultural systems. 

The soluble sugar concentration of the stem refers to the amount of sugars, such as glucose and fructose, that are present in the liquid inside the stem of a plant. These sugars are essential for the overall growth, development, and metabolic processes of the plant. In the case of sugarcane plants, the soluble sugar concentration of the stem is of particular importance. Sugarcane is a highly efficient plant when it comes to producing and storing sugars in its stem. The stem of sugarcane is thick and fibrous, and it acts as a storage organ for the plant. The accumulated sugars in the stem are later used for the synthesis of sucrose, which is then extracted for various commercial purposes, including the production of table sugar, ethanol, and other sugar-based products. The soluble sugar concentration in the stem can vary depending on several factors. One of the most crucial factors influencing the concentration is the stage of growth of the plant. Sugarcane plants undergo different growth stages, and the sugar concentration in the stem tends to increase as the plant matures. During the early stages of growth, the plant develops its photosynthetic capacity, and the sugars produced by the leaves are transported to the stem for storage. As the plant reaches its maximum biomass and maturity, the sugar accumulation is at its peak. Environmental conditions also play a significant role in determining the soluble sugar concentration in the stem. Factors such as sunlight, temperature, and water availability can impact the photosynthetic activity of the plant, thus affecting sugar production and accumulation. Sufficient sunlight and warm temperatures are generally favorable for sugar accumulation. On the other hand, water stress or extreme temperatures can hinder the plant's ability to produce sugars and decrease the concentration in the stem. Cultivation practices, such as fertilization and irrigation, can also influence the soluble sugar concentration in the stem. Adequate nutrient availability, especially nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, is crucial for the plant's metabolic processes, including sugar synthesis. Proper irrigation practices, ensuring that the plant has a sufficient supply of water, can contribute to optimal sugar production and accumulation in the stem. Monitoring and managing the soluble sugar concentration in the stem is essential for sugarcane growers and agronomists. It helps determine the optimum time for harvest, considering that sugar content is a vital quality parameter for the industry. Additionally, monitoring sugar concentration can provide insights into the plant's physiological status and overall health. By assessing and understanding the factors that influence sugar accumulation, growers can make informed

We propose an indicator to measure the coverage rate of a service plant called Coverage Index (CI). This indicator is calculated as the surface covered by the service plant, divided by the total vineyard surface during a specific period ‘p’ (Eq. 1).Different techniques (cover cropping, the use of high-competitive cultivars, the choice of plant arrangement and seeding time, tillage systems, allelochemicals, etc.) and methodological approaches (e.g., soil seedbank analysis, weed adaptation along environmental gradients, and the analysis of weed abundance and diversity) have shown ...Estimating the response of weed species on those practices is crucial for both biodiversity maintenance and alternative weed control methods. Many experiments have confirmed the fundamental role of tillage intensity and nutrition supply in weed species' abundance and diversity. For instance, in some studies, the abundance of ...Weed coverage and impacts on soil properties and biota varied for the different weed management strategies; with only the glyphosate, glufosinate and imazapyr treatments significantly reducing weed coverage at both sites across all seasons after 12 weeks. The difference in impact on weed coverage between the different products ...Here, we review services and disservices associated with weeds in annual agroecosystems and present two case studies from the United States to illustrate how weeds growing in fall-planted cover crops can provide ground cover, decrease potential soil losses, and effectively manage nitrogen. We argue that in certain circumstances ...A map of three categories of weed coverage was produced with 86% of overall accuracy. In the experimental field, the area free of weeds was 23%, and the area with low weed coverage (<5% weeds) was 47%, which indicated a high potential for reducing herbicide application or other weed operations. The OBIA procedure computes multiple ...Most research in the crop-weed competition domain is limited to assessing crop yield losses due to weed pressure and other crop-weed interactions, overlooking the significant uptake of soil-water by weeds that exacerbates global water constraints and threatens productivity and profitability. The objective of this review was to ...Weed-Control Costs . Farmers whotake prevented plant coverage also must remember that weeds will grow, even if the crop doesn't. Mark Loux, Ohio State University Extension weeds specialist, advises farmers to budget for two passes of either mowing, tillage, or herbicide applications.Many plants are low-growing and spreading in habit and may be termed ground-cover, but the prime requisite of a good ground cover plant is to provide a rapid, dense cover, to suppress germination and development of weed seeds and to eliminate the need for weed control measures.Dragon's blood sedum may be the hardiest and most versatile of all weed-suppressing ground covers. A cultivar of the succulent Sedum spurium, dragon's blood ('Schorbuser Blut') is hardy in Zones 3-8. Not only does it grow in full sun as well as partial shade, but it also thrives in poor soil.

1.1. What are service plants and why are they important? Service plants are spontaneous vegetation (weeds) and sown plant species associated with a perennial crop in the rows or inter-rows with a high potential to provide ecosystem functions and services. In the literature,Service plants are spontaneous vegetation (weeds) and sown plant species associated with a perennial crop in the rows or inter-rows with a high potential to provide ecosystem functions and services.Service plants are spontaneous vegetation (weeds) and sown plant species associated with a perennial crop in the rows or inter-rows with a high potential to provide ecosystem functions and services. In literature, these plants are often named ‘vegetation cover’ (Hall et al., 2020; Winter et al., 2018) but without linking their activity to ...Row Spacing. Row spacing interacts with plant population and the arrangement of plants within the row. From: The Solar Corridor Crop System, 2019. Related terms: Herbicide; Cultivar; Maize; Weed Management; Water Use Efficiency; Planting Density; Irrigation; Weeds; Weed Control; Plant DensityThe differences in weed coverage between the 68-cm row spacing and 17- and 34-cm row spacings were less pronounced in this environment compared to the Goldsboro 2013 environment . Weed coverage declined with increasing seeding rate in the 17-cm row spacing, but not in the other row spacings .Bilgili et al. (2003) conducted a field research to examine the influence of different row spacing (17.5 cm, 35 cm, 52.5cm, 70 cm) on seed yield and yield component of Brassica rapa L. in Turkey. They found maximum plant height (147.3cm) and number of plants (122 m-2) at narrow row spacing 17.5 cm.A review of row spacing experiments included in this review revealed that narrow row spacings have provided significant reductions in the late-season density of weeds in the majority of soybean experiments but only rarely in corn. This research also indicates that narrow row soybeans are more likely to impact the critical time of weed removal ...row and alleyway weed coverage and densities of broadleaf and grass weeds. A winter annual cover crop was grown in alleyways of the cover-cropped treatments and was mowed in spring. The mowed residue was managed as follows: 1) residue transferred in-row as mulch representing the industry practice of ‘‘mow-and-The operation of inter-row hoes is less requiring than weed harrows where the operator needs to learn the timing and settings that provide effective weed control while preserving the crop. A weed harrow treats both weeds and crop while hoe shares work the inter-row zone only and thus avoid impacting the crop plants. Fig. 1. Inter-row hoeing in ...Mechanical weed control may damage crop plants; therefore, our review of current and future intra-row weeding technology is based on the assumption that crop damage should be acceptably low to the farmer and should be in the same range as damage from conventional chemical weed control.

• The great diversity of weeds (weeds with short or long cycle; annual, biennial and perennial, dicotyledonous or mon-ocotyledonous; erect or creeping) hampers their management. They can be controlled simply by applying a broad-leaf herbicide in the intended plant cover area, which eliminates the other weeds.Inter- row hoeing usually provides a complete weed control in the inter-row zone unless rainy weather prevail for long periods. The operation of inter-row hoes is less requiring than weed harrows where the operator needs to learn the timing and settings that provide effective weed control while preserving the crop.Highlights: The majority of mechanical weeders have weeding efficiency between 60 and 80 percent. That functions at forward speeds ranging from 0.7-9.7 kmph (0.43-6.0 miles/hour) and depths between...In the inter-row, the growth of the spontaneous flora was limited by the high temperatures during the summer. Among the living mulch species, sage and lemongrass guaranteed an almost full soil cover, reducing the need for weed management along the row, as well as increasing the beneficial insects without influencing the young tree ...This paper presents detailed simulation, laboratory and field investigations into the design and performance of a novel mechanical system for inter- and intra-row weed control. The mechanical ...Cover crops or companion crops are increasingly used in cropping systems to favor biological regulations and deliver agroecosystem services such as weed, pest, disease, or erosion control, as well as nitrogen fixation (Quintarelli et al. 2022 ).The newest guidance-equipped inter-row hoeing systems can cover up to 83 % of the field [ 1, 2 ]. Unfortunately, the weeds occurring within the remaining area between (intra-row) and around the crop plants (close-to-crop) have a significant influence on plant development and yield.Although inter-row cultivation is a relatively effective method of weed control, weeds in the intra-row still often require manual labor . Weed control in crop rows is one of the main problems in ecological farming, as it has a significant impact on crop yields [ 25 ].Intra-row weeds are those that grow within the line of row crop plants and are not affected by inter-row cultivation, such as hoeing. Intra-row weeds, if insufficiently controlled, cause major problems for organic growers in row crops, such as vegetables and maize (Zea mays L.). Manual intra-row weeding can be laborious, particularly ...Numerous prototypes exist for inter-row weeding but very limited for intra-row weed eradication. This study developed a tractor drawn integrated inter- and intra-row weeding (IIIRW) system for field crops. Active rotary tines were used for intra-row weeding and passive tines for inter-row weeding.

The simple coverage problem requires that UAVs inspect every portion of the field by visiting (and inspecting) each cell at least once. Ideally, every cell is visited only once by one UAV and the coverage time \(t_c\) is minimised.(3) weed n = f-f min f max-f min s max-s min + s min where f denotes the current weed’s fitness, the best and least fitness of the current population is represented by f max and f min. The maximum and least value of a weed is represented by s max and s min .OE indicates the proportion of frames with an observed weed coverage that was misclassified as being of a different coverage, and CE indicates the proportion of frames classified with levels of weed coverage that really correspond to other levels of coverage.Weed coverage (%) for the different methods of weed control in 2017 to 2019. (a-c): Weed assessment 2 (after the pre-emergence bean herbicide application). (d-f): Weed assessment 3 (14 days after ...Similarly, total weed coverage and perennial coverage in reduced tillage treatments were two to three times greater compared with conventional treatments (Sans et al., 2011). Weed biomass in barley showed also higher rates in the conservation compared to the conventional tillage treatment ( Vakali et al., 2011 ).Data were estimated via human vision, and total weed coverage, i.e., the percentage of a plot’s area covered by weeds when projecting the weed plants vertically to ground level, was assigned to each plot. Weed coverage values could be in the range of 0–100%. Plots were located semi-randomly in each field to constitute a range in ...The sampling points are continuous and the interpolation methods are used at the minimum levels. The experiment result shows that this weed mapping method can map weed under limited conditions.Shallow conservation tillage also led to an average increase of weed coverage and weed species number in regard to ST and CTD. Weed coverage was 60% higher, and the weed species number was 66% higher, with CTS compared to ST, which was not significantly different from CTD. All investigated parameters of maize weediness were, on ...In each cell, the percentage of weed coverage was calculated, and Moran's I, a common spatial autocorrelation test (Moran 1950; Krähmer et al. 2020), was used to describe the spatial pattern of the grid cells comprised of weeds (weed coverage > 0%) using the “Spatial Autocorrelation Global Moran’s I” in ArcMap 10.5.This study aims to account for these three feasibility factors using three additional metrics. This paper introduces a new metric weed coverage rate (WCR), which identifies the proportion of weeds in the dataset that fall within the target area of a sprayer given a set of detections.

Row cover ranges in thicknesses. A lighter weight fabric, might be labeled as .45 or .5 oz/sq. yd., whereas a heavier weight fabric might be labeled as somewhere between 1.5 and 2.2 oz/sq. yd. Row cover can be cut to size using sharp scissors, which is helpful because it typically comes in large rolls of varying widths and lengths.Row cover, or garden row fabric, is a thin, breathable fabric with many versatile uses in the garden. It allows sunlight and water in while keeping bugs and extreme weather out. The lightweight material is typically spun-bonded from polyester or polypropylene and is designed to protect your crops from environmental stressors.Also known as Garden Fabrics, the floating row cover is mostly a thin plastic or material that is either transparent or semi-transparent and is used to shield plants from harsh weather conditions such as frost and intense sunlight. It also acts as a protective cover for the plants against harmful insects.Roots were studied in the setting of three inter-row conditions: sugarcane with full chemical weed control, sugarcane-jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) intercropping, and sugarcane with spontaneous weeds in the inter-row. Root mappings were conducted at 3.5, 6, 8, and 11 months after sugarcane planting in two vertical trenches per age ...We finally got all our plants in the ground. We covered the garden area with weed barrier or row cover. And planted our tomatoes, peppers, and artichokes. The weed fabric should prevent...1. Cross-Pollination If you want to save your seeds and would like to avoid raising hybrids, it’s important to prevent cross-pollination. One way of doing this is to cover the plants with row covers. They will stop the wind from pollinating the plants and also deter bees in some cases. 2. Pest ProtectionYour guide to growing garlic in winter for a delicious season-long harvest. Step 3: Secure your row cover to the ground with landscaping pins, either just on the long sides or on all four sides. Step 4: Remove the row covers from time to time to water and weed your garden.Use row covers to warm garden soil and protect tender seedlings or vegetable plants from frost. Row covers are made from materials that are either waterproof or allow moisture to pass through them. Row covers may be either tunnels or caps like mini-greenhouses or floating blankets of breathable fabric held by supports over the plants. Install ...As much as we love row covers, so do the weeds. One disadvantage to using row covers in the garden is weed growth. Weeds also love the slight temperature increase from the row covers and grow at an accelerated rate. We think the advantages outweigh this disadvantage, so go cover your garden!The easiest way to manage weeds is to spray them with herbicide. When applied to a small weed, it shrivels up and dies, decomposes, and isn’t a big concern. However, when a bed is full of a groundcover plant herbicide injury could occur. There are a few exceptions of specialty herbicides and these cover only a minimal amount of weed varieties.

Fine root distribution, root length densities, and a soil colonization index were estimated from the root intersects, in relation to plant root co-occurrence. We found that both legumes and weeds in the inter-row decreased the total sugarcane fine root length by 17 to 30% compared to situation of chemical weed control from 6 months ...• The great diversity of weeds (weeds with short or long cycle; annual, biennial and perennial, dicotyledonous or mon-ocotyledonous; erect or creeping) hampers their management. They can be controlled simply by applying a broad-leaf herbicide in the intended plant cover area, which eliminates the other weeds.Weed cover on undisturbed inter-rows was generally lower or equivalent to weed cover on rows. Weed cover on inter-rows compacted by tractor wheels was always equivalent or higher than weed cover on rows. Using inter-rows to detect weeds could underestimate weed pressure in corn and soybean in Québec, unless the inter-rows trampled ...Tables 2, 3 and 4 show the effect of inter row spacing and weed control on weed cover score, weed density and weed dry matter production. Inter-row spacing did not have any significant effect (p≥0.05) on these parameters in the early seasons of 2009 and 2010.Vegetation sensors could be used in the inter-rows to trigger herbicide spraying on both rows and inter-rows if weed cover on and between the crop rows is uniform. To verify this hypothesis, weed cover on and between corn rows was evaluated using photographs acquired in corn fields at the 3 to 5 leaf stage. A one hectare plot was sampled in ...Inter- row hoeing usually provides a complete weed control in the inter-row zone unless rainy weather prevail for long periods. The operation of inter-row hoes is less requiring than weed harrows where the operator needs to learn the timing and settings that provide effective weed control while preserving the crop.Review and discussion of inter-row and intra-row mechanical weeding, two different mechanical weed control techniques. In particular, reviews and comparisons of the most popular manual...A green cover should be ensured in the inter-row alleyway to prevent soil erosion and allow the transit of machineries, whereas weed management along the row is mandatory to reduce the competition for water and nutrients.

This row is being covered to help maintain adequate soil temperatures for seed germination in direct-sown crops. The covers are supported by fiberglass rods, wires, PVC hoops, plastic-coated steel hoops, or anything strong and bendable.So, service plants or cover crops? The answer is both — it’s simply a matter of scale. A cover crop is a planted crop grown during intercropping periods, typically not harvested that aims to cover the soil for various purposes. It is one of the applications made possible by service crops. However, service crops are not limited to ...Here, we present an overview of the current uses of intercropped service plants in temperate cropping systems, with the main services they provide and their management.

In vineyards, service plants target specific services depending on the management strategy implemented by the winegrower ...Service plants include spontaneous vegetation or sown species of cover crops associated with perennial crops in the rows or inter-rows with a high potential to provide ecosystem functions...Inter-row vegetation in vineyards is classified as a service crop as it provides many ecosystem services. The vegetation is often removed but maintaining them can mitigate the negative effects on the environment. However, the type of species or mixture choice can affect their success.Here, we present an overview of the current uses of intercropped service plants in temperate cropping systems, with the main services they provide and their management. (1) First, we show that a limited range of service crop species, mostly from the Fabaceae family, have been studied to date. This finding suggests that the diversity ...The vegetation cover in each inter-row and the plant species composition was determined in spring 2016 and 2017 in all experimental plots. We determined the percentage cover with grasses, herbaceous species and legumes in two 1 m 2 squares per treatment inter-row.Inter-row cover cropping: Spontaneous grass cover crops The use of spontaneous flora growing in the inter-rows can bring great advantages to the olive or- chards. Grass cover crops have advantages for erosion control and water retention as they provide effective soil protection and high biomass production.Sustainable vineyard management in inter-rows may improve biodiversity and ecosystem service provision in landscapes with a high density of vineyards.Here we showed that the abundance of arthropods generally increased in vineyards with low intensity of soil management that favoured the development of inter-row vegetation. Plant species richness ...Our results demonstrate that inter-row management practices affect vegetation cover, diversity of plants and some invertebrates. This can increase the provision of ecosystem services in Romanian vineyards, such as the conservation of species, soil erosion mitigation and potentially natural pest control. In agricultural landscapes ...The objective of this study is to propose a methodology that allows: (i) to identify different inter-row soil managements in vineyards from open-source RS data and (ii) to describe the growth dynamics of cover crops within the inter-row when the adopted soil management is known. Furthermore, a weighted version of the well-known NDVI ...

The weed populations in all three efficacy trials consisted mainly of grasses and broadleaf weeds, however, there were variations in the level of weed infestation, the specific weed species, and eventual weed coverage in the absence of herbicidal control in each trial (Table 1). Four and a half months after harvest, the untreated ...In particular, a trial of the mechanical weeding array in a fallow field over six weeks maintained the weed coverage in robot treated sections to be 1.5%, compared to 37% in the control areas not treated by the robot—a reduction in excess of 90% in weed coverage. BackgroundWeed coverage (spring after herbicide application to test if CA affects weed control efforts in the main crop) Soil nitrate content at three depths and three times (in early spring, after crop harvest in August and at the end of the vegetation season in November)It was held down with metal staples plus a border of soil, but this didn’t prevent it being blown away in the wind; we had to replace it three times during the trial after high winds and heavy rain. There was around 20% weed coverage on the plot at the end of the trial.???Jan 2023 Peter Berk Damijan Kelc Peter Vindiš The purpose of the study was to investigate the alternative methods of weed control in the vineyard under 'Sauvignon' vines to reduce ecological...Abstract. Cover crops (CC) are biological tools with a great potential for weed control, but the suppression level depends on the CC species and management. A 2-year study was performed in the eighth year of a long-term experiment located in Central Spain to study the effect of replacing winter fallow by barley (.Weed coverage was reduced by up to 75% using this most effective herbicide strategy and by up to 61% through mechanical weed control, compared to the control. The additional effects of post-emergence treatment on the pre-emergence herbicide control resulted in a 16.5% weed coverage decline.The different sowing methods had no effect on weed coverage or weed contamination in the cleaned seed. Increasing sowing rate usually had a negative influence on seed yield, while weed coverage/contamination was not significantly affected.Coverage was too low at spray volumes of 100 to 200 L ha −1, for adequate contact activity of both PA-MPEG and PA. Weed control was significantly increased when PA-MPEG application was made at lower boom height with reduced distance to weed canopy, or under warm and dry climate conditions. The results indicate the potential of PA ...First of all, a literature search has been performed (PubMed and SciFinder) on clinical trials which involved the administration of Cannabis for medical use over the last three years.

Here, we studied the impact of four cover crop mixtures varying in species richness and functional diversity, three cover crop termination strategies (i.e. frost, rolling and glyphosate) and two levels of irrigation at the cover crop sowing on soil nitrogen and carbon dynamics, soil microbial diversity and structure as well as the ...The trial was conducted at Borderview Research Farm in Alburgh, Vermont (Table 1) to evaluate the impact of planting date and cover crop mix on biomass yield and percent cover at the end of the growing season and after the winter. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replications. Table 2.Ongoing research continues to identify and test “new” plant species for use as weed-suppressive cover plants (e.g., Brust et al., 2014), and nascent breeding efforts could further improve these and existing cover plant species in the area of weed management (Foley, 1999; Wayman et al., 2017).In 2020, the University of Vermont Extension Northwest Crops and Soils Program investigated the impact of spring cover crop termination methods on a subsequent soybean crop’s yield and quality at Borderview Research Farm in Alburgh, VT.Ground cover was similar between the tillage, no-till (21% cover), early termination, plant termination (21% cover), and forage harvest treatments. At Lancaster, weed ground cover for the late termination (8% cover) soil management treatment was lower than the no-till (22% cover) treatment, while ground cover was similar between the ...Introduction Cover crops are important tools employed in organic agriculture to improve soil quality and fertility ( 1 – 4 ). Living cover crops can prevent soil erosion during fallow periods and compete directly with weeds for sunlight and nutrients ( 5, 6 ).In the studied systems, the 2018 mid-season cover crops fostered a soil bacterial community distinct from early season cover crops and fallow, reinforcing the selectivity of some plant species. However, the difference in planting dates cannot be separated from the cover crop treatments, limiting the interpretation of these results.Over the past six years at the Cornell Organic Cropping Systems Trial, we have planted several species of cover crops at many times. In this article I will summarize how they have performed. First, a little background. We have grain and vegetable field experiments.Only “trad cover models” were utilised to test the main effects of T. fluminensis invasion on native plant growth forms as we were more interested in identifying patterns along the gradient of ...In natural ecosystems, positive effects of plant diversity on ecosystem functioning have been widely observed, yet whether this is true in cropping systems remains unclear. Here we assessed the ...

Here, a framework that incorporates (1) pin-point cover data, (2) visually determined cover data, and (3) ordinal cover classification systems (e.g., Braun-Blanquet cover data) is presented and tested on simulated plant cover data. The effect of measurement error when applying a visual determination of plant cover is considered.ful in comparative studies of cover meth-ods. A Field Trial A frame was constructed to contain five contiguous plots that Daubenmire de-scribed for use in his method. The goal was to reduce most sources of error in vi-sual estimates of plant cover obtained from plots. A trial evaluation of the frame was conducted on reclaimed land of TheModels for plant cover data Abstract 1. Plant cover data collected by monitoring schemes are often expressed on interval-censored scales to reduce field effort. Existing statistical approaches to such data may not make full use of available information, or may both induce bias and assume moreWith a mean GPP of 2.0 kg C m−2 yr−1 forests represent the most productive land cover on two thirds of the total area suitable for any of these land cover types, while grasslands and croplands ...Abstract.

The greater the cumulative soil cover, the less surface run-off is generated, and thus the erosion of soil and the transport of soil, nutrients, pesticides and faecal microbes to waterways are ...

Temporal diversity of cultivated and non-cultivated plants (rotation) The temporal diversity of plant cover, at the field scale, is primarily driven by farmer decision-making for crop rotations, cover cropping and green manures. Rotations have been used to reduce plant diseases, weeds and pests ( McLaughlin and Mineau, 1995 ).Identifying plant growth form impact thresholds would elucidate which components of the recipient vegetation community are most severely impacted by non-native plant invasion and hence help...The cover crop trial experiment consisted of 1.3 m x 4.6 m plots, with 3 replicated plots per cover crop. Prior to cover crop planting in 2019, the experimental site was planted with oats. After oats was harvested for haylage in August of 2019 the field was conventionally tilled with a chisel plow (20 cm depth) followed by a field ...The aim of this study is to develop a statistical framework that is suited for modeling different types of plant cover measurement in such a way that it will be possible to compare samples of plant cover data that have been obtained by different methods through time or space.framework. Ecosphere 5(2):20. http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/ES13-00300.1 Abstract. Plant cover is measured by different methods and it is important to be able to estimate mean cover and to compare estimates of plant cover across different sampling methods in a coherent statistical framework. Here, a framework that incorporates (1) pin-point cover ...Ideally the soil cover indicator provides an estimate of the number of days in a year when agricultural land is covered by plants or plant residues.

The experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replications. Table 2.This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of mycorrhizal fungi and glomalin contents in soil under different cover crops, with and without the application of Nitrogen in the cover. The following cover plants were used: Crotalaria juncea (Crotalaria juncea L.), wild beans from Ceará (Canavalia brasiliensis Mart. ex Benth.), Guandú ...A recent study also reported that cover cropping has positive effects on plant production leading to an increase in crop yields up to 24% in reduced tillage organic systems but only of 2% in conventional system with tillage ( Wittwer et al., 2017 ).In this experiment, we compare the effects of four cover crop treatments (a legume cover crop, a non-legume cover crop, a mixture of several species, and a control treatment without cover crops ...without adequate soil protection and cover. However, growing cover plants and green manures in the off-season after soybean, including intercropping with second-crop corn (Ceccon et al. 2013), is a better option (Ferreira et al. 2018). Cover plants play a fundamental role in the no-tillage system, providing more straw on the soil,In natural ecosystems, positive effects of plant diversity on ecosystem functioning have been widely observed, yet whether this is true in cropping systems remains unclear. Here we assessed the ...In corn and soybean, weed ground cover was lower for soil management with cereal rye cover crop terminated two weeks after cash crop planting (≤ 7% weed cover) compared to all other soil management practices (≥ 23% weed cover) when a preemergence herbicide was not used.Our results suggest that cover crops may reduce the potential for springtime nitrogen leaching losses by retaining nitrogen in the soil organic pool, and they may also have impacts on the soil microbial community that are particularly relevant for nitrogen cycling and decomposition of plant residues. IntroductionThis study focused on a wheat-cover crop rotation near Havre, Montana that tested two cover crop mixtures (five species planted early season and seven species planted mid-season) with three different termination methods (chemical, grazed, or hayed and baled) against a fallow control under ambient or induced warmer/drier conditions ...

Here we assessed the ...Almost half of the arable land (46 %) was covered by normal winter crops. Cover or intermediate crops, plant residues and multi-annual plants occupy shares of 8 %, 7 % and 8 % respectively in arable land. The soil cover on arable land during winter varies among countries.The Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) was selected to develop two additional approaches. One is based on a regression biomass prediction model (R 2 of 0.80 and 0.66 for FM and DM, respectively) and leads to an accurate estimation at levels of FM lower than 3 kg/m 2 (0.6 kg DM/m 2). The other approach is based on a ...In corn and soybean, weed ground cover was lower for soil management with cereal rye cover crop terminated two weeks after cash crop planting (≤ 7% weed cover) compared to all other soil management practices (≥ 23% weed cover) when a preemergence herbicide was not used.Here we present a series of maps detailing the evolution of European forest cover during last 12000 years. Our reconstructions are based on the Modern Analogue Technique (MAT): a calibration dataset is built by coupling modern pollen samples with the corresponding satellite-based forest cover data.Globally, we found a significant ( P -value ≤ 0.05) relative increase of 20–24% (Δ rel) in the value of the sensitivity of energy fluxes to LAI over 2000–2016 compared with 1982–1999 ...Models for plant cover data Tweetable abstract Plant cover data may currently be modelled inefficiently.

The objectives of this study were (i) to quantify the influence of 5 cover crop species on formation and size distribution of soil macropores (>36 μm Ø); (ii) to explore the changes in the originally developed pore architecture after an additional season of cover crop growth; and (iii) to assess the relative contributions of plant ...Only “trad cover models” were utilised to test the main effects of T. fluminensis invasion on native plant growth forms as we were more interested in identifying patterns along the gradient of ...Abstract. Cover crops (plants grown in an agricultural rotation between cash crops) can significantly improve soil quality via sequestering carbon, retaining nutrients, decreasing soil erosion...However, plants under prolonged snow cover seemed to compensate for the shorter growing period, likely increasing carbon allocation to growth. In fact, these latter showed larger needles and low starch content at the beginning of the growing season. Variability between treatments slightly decreased over time, suggesting a progressive ...Groundcover or ground cover is any plant that grows over an area of ground. Groundcover provides protection of the topsoil from erosion and drought. In an ecosystem, the ground cover forms the layer of vegetation below the shrub layer known as the herbaceous layer. The most widespread ground covers are grasses of various types.If we exclude EUP, all treatments had a relatively high plant cover, at both the beginning (from 59.2% to 87.5% plant cover) and the end of the 2015 season (from 55.3% to 91.1% plant cover) (Table 2). Plant cover was low in the early season for EUP (17.6%) but reached 51.7% at the end of the growing season.We review current guidelines and precedents on the issue of coverage, as well as their underlying considerations, for four major study designs, which include de novo genome sequencing, genome ...Compared to plant-free controls, cover cropping had a significant impact on soil nitrogen levels in these short-term, springtime trials, but we found very few overall differences between plots that used different functional groups of cover crops (brassicas vs. grasses vs. legumes). By far, the most important differences appeared to ...Without annual winter cover crops to intercept plant available N, losses of N in Systems 1 and 2 were undoubtedly higher than in Systems 3, 4 and 5 that were cover cropped annually. For example, another study in the Salinas valley, found that winter NO 3 -N leached after conventional broccoli was 25.5 g m -2 under bare fallow and ...In natural ecosystems, positive effects of plant diversity on ecosystem functioning have been widely observed, yet whether this is true in cropping systems remains unclear. Here we assessed the ...

Aboveground biomass (AGB) stands as a pivotal phenotypic attribute in crops, wielding significant importance in monitoring crop growth, estimating yield, and evaluating eco-environmental quality (Walter et al., 2018, Li et al., 2021). Moreover, AGB constitutes a vital element in global carbon cycle investigations (Santi et al., 2017).1 Measuring Plant Cover I. Definition = % of ground surface covered by vegetation or other coverages including rocks, litter, moss, or bareground Types of cover measurements? - Need to define A. Basal Cover = Measure only the proportion of the plant that extends into the soil. 1. Basal cover is generally more stable from year to year and less ...In this final section, we discuss why plant growth measurements are important, and more specifically why the joint analysis of the different facets of plant growth is essential to build and inform plant growth models. 1. Coordination between cell production and tissue expansion.Different physiological plants traits, such as chlorophyl content, canopy temperature, and photosynthesis rate, and agronomic plant traits, such as plant height, leaf length, grain length, and plant diameter, are relevant in studying plant growth and development in the field .Cover Plant. The larger plant cover in the protected plot maintains, at a microclimatic level, a relative higher crust moisture content creating more favorable conditions for NA during the rainy season (Stewart et al., 1977). From: Emerging Technologies and Management of Crop Stress Tolerance, Volume 1, 2014. Related terms: Soil Erosion; Soil ...The data collected consisted of plant height (PH), number of tillers, number and length of leaves and fresh yield. The yield and chemical analysis of forage samples were analyzed for dry matter ...We conducted three separate experiments for the validation of canopy height, canopy ground cover, and above-ground biomass using the Phenomobile Lite. Canopy height was validated in Experiment 1 (EXP1), canopy ground cover was validated in Experiment 2 (EXP2) and above-ground biomass was validated in Experiment 3 (EXP3).We used an experimental precipitation gradient combined with mimicked acute hay harvest (clipping once a year) to examine (1) whether hay harvest influences precipitation effects on plant...Figure 26 shows that erosion is dependent not only on plant cover but also on plant height above the ground. For example, when plant cover is 100% but is 4 metres high, erosion will be about 75% of that on a bare plot; if the cover is 2 metres high, erosion will be about 50%; and if it is 50 cm high, erosion will still be about 18%. However, if ...The density coefficient is multiplied by a basal K c representing full cover conditions, K cb full, to produce a basal crop coefficient that represents actual conditions of ET and vegetation coverage when the soil surface is dry. K cb full is estimated primarily as a function of crop height.

Previously reported maize phyllochron values range from 61.7 to 85.1 °C d leaf −1 below the turning point and 25.3 to 35.3 °C d leaf −1 above the turning point (Muchow and Carberry, 1989; Zhu et al., 2014).Biophysical crop models convert GDD accumulation to leaf numbers by using a constant parameter termed phyllochron (°C-day leaf −1) or leaf appearance rate (LAR; leaf o C-day −1 ). However, such important parameter values are rarely estimated for modern maize hybrids.ects of temperature and photoperiod on the daily rate of seedling emergence (1/t50%) and the rate of leaf appearance (leaves d71) were quanti®ed for 12 diverse legume cover crop species. Six tropical or subtropical species were grown in 12 combinations of mean temperature (16.8, 21.8 and 26.88C) and photoperiod (11.5, 12.5, 13.5 and 14.5 h d71).We measured trait values and leaf areas of 17 tropical cover species grown for 1 month in a growth chamber. Strong positive and negative covariations were observed between SM, LMF a and RGR a , revealing a “syndrome” of traits and suggesting trade-offs between traits.Two approaches quantifying potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Kennebec) leaf appearance rates were evaluated: a thermal time approach using the phyllochron, and a nonlinear temperature response...Biophysical crop models convert GDD accumulation to leaf numbers by using a constant parameter termed phyllochron (°C-day leaf -1) or leaf appearance rate (LAR; leaf o C-day -1 ). However, such important parameter values are rarely estimated for modern maize hybrids.Here, we conducted a series of experiments in the field to quantify and disentangle the effects of sowing date and cultivar on maize leaf collar appearance (LCA). A bilinear model was found to accurately fit maize LCA (R > 0.99); this model revealed a slower rate of LCA for the first leaves compared to the last leaves.Crop growth rate (CGR) and crop nitrogen acquisition rate (CNR) can be used as two indicators of the ability of cover crops to produce these services in agrosystems. We used leaf functional traits to characterise the growth strategies of 36 cover crops as an approach to assess their ability to grow and acquire N rapidly. We measured ...In this paper, leaf surface phenotypes are characterized for 349 leaf samples based on polarized light reflectance measured at Brewster’s Angle, and microscopic observation. Four main leaf surface phenotypes (glossy wax, glaucous wax, high trichome density, and glabrous) were identified for the leaf samples. The microscopic and ...Effects of different covering materials treatments on plant functional traits. The specific leaf area is closely related to the growth rate of plants. It can reflect the balance between the acquisition and utilization of carbon by plants [ 29, 30 ].

The analysis of plant growth fundamentally changes when the focus shifts from individual plants to communities, because land surface area becomes an additional reference metric (Table 2). For example, while individual plants may grow less or slower, growth per unit land surface area may still be higher, so that any quantification of ...For example, choose Delosperma brunnthaleri, a hardy ground cover that grows around 2 inches tall and 2 feet wide with yellow flowers and ideal for zones 4 to 9. Select Delosperma floribundum 'Starburst', a mat-forming cultivar with pink flowers and white centers for zones 6 to 8.However, when left to grow on its own, the perennial is a spreading shrub or ground cover, growing 1½ to 2 feet tall and 4 to 5 feet in spread. The plant thrives in zones 7b to 10b and grows in moist, well-draining soil. It prefers bright, indirect light with around four hours of direct sunlight daily.Ground cover was estimated from LiDAR using two methodologies: red reflectance image and canopy height. In contrast to NDVI, LiDAR was not affected by saturation at high ground cover, and the comparison of both LiDAR methodologies showed strong association ( r2 = 0.92 and slope = 1.02) at ground cover above 0.8.The coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) values for measured and estimated plant height across various growth stages were 0.93 and 0.17 m, respectively.1. Data description The dataset presented in this article (doi: 10.18167/DVN1/MNMXRZ) provides data on the growth of 17 species of cover crops grown as individuals in growth chamber during one month. It is composed of 17 rows and 18 columns.The study focussed mainly on questions (1) how do the ALS point cloud metrics change over time in thinned stands, (2) what is the effect of phenology on detecting thinning cuttings and forest height growth using sparse ALS point clouds from bitemporal measurements, (3) are thinning events detectable if both ALS measurements are done after thinning?Groundcover or ground cover is any plant that grows over an area of ground. Groundcover provides protection of the topsoil from erosion and drought . In an ecosystem, the ground cover forms the layer of vegetation below the shrub layer known as the herbaceous layer. The most widespread ground covers are grasses of various types.We used an experimental precipitation gradient combined with mimicked acute hay harvest (clipping once a year) to examine (1) whether hay harvest influences precipitation effects on plant...The objective of this study was to assess the effect of N fertilizer rates on plant N indicators: leaf N, petiole sap NO 3 and chlorophyll meter (SPAD) readings and the plant growth measurements; plant height, canopy width, and percent ground cover, and to determine inter-correlations among them.

The ability of cover crops to cover the soil increased with rate of increase in height and leaf appearance rate and tended to decrease with thermal time for emergence. Accordingly, weed control efficiency (low weed cover and dry mass) was positively correlated with ground cover, height and biomass.

L’apex, le sommet de la plante, est souvent coupé par les cultivateurs pour favoriser le développement des branches secondaires. La plante se développe alors en largeur plutôt qu’en hauteur et les têtes se rapprochent de la source lumineuse.The field PH, which is referred to as the ground-truth height (cm) from the ground to the apex (highest point), differs depending on the plant growth stage, such as a leaf in the vegetative stage or an ear in a mature stage (Han, Thomasson, Bagnall, Pugh et al., Citation 2018). In the present study, the field PH before flowering was measured ...Single-row plots with 12.5-feet length and 30-inch row spacing were used. The final plant height was measured at maturity from the soil surface to the panicle apex. The environmental mean of plant height was calculated as the average plant height of the entire population in each environment.Consistent with this model, the quadruple mutant tcp8 tcp14 tcp15 tcp22 exhibits severe dwarfism and reduced responsiveness to GA action. Altogether, we conclude that GA-regulated DELLA-TCP interactions in inflorescence shoot apex provide a novel mechanism to control plant height.We defined the leaf length (L) as the longest extension from leaf apex to base (i.e. connection point of leaf blade and petiole). Leaf width (W) corresponds to the longest extension of any two points on the blade edge perpendicular to the leaf length axis, that is the axes connecting leaf apex and base (Shi et al., 2019a; see Fig. 1 ...Summary. Regulation of plant height, one of the most important agro- nomic traits, is the focus of intensive research for improving crop performance [1]. Stem elongation takes place as a result of repeated cell divisions and subsequent elongation of cells produced by apical and intercalary meristems.Phenology and plant architecture are examples of quantitative traits that are fundamental contributors to the adaptation of wheat.

Multiplying these numbers will provide an estimated total number of leaves.Leaf, any usually flattened green outgrowth from the stem of a vascular plant. Leaves are the primary sites of photosynthesis and manufacture food for plants. They are an integral part of the stem system and can be modified into a variety of other plant organs.However, larger leaves may be more susceptible to herbivory and have higher within-leaf support costs (Niinemets et al., 2006). A number of leaf venation properties also vary predictably with leaf size (Sack et al., 2012; Baird et al., 2021). For all these reasons, leaf size is a key element of numerous studies on plant functional ecology. Its ...In this study, we focus on the task of leaf counting. The number of leaves a plant has is one of the visual key traits (phenotype) describing its development and growth (Dobrescu et al., 2017). It enables growth rate estimation and is related to the health status of the plant and its yield potential (Telfer et al., 1997; Walter and Schurr, 1999).The arrangement of leaves on a stem is known as phyllotaxy. The number and placement of a plant’s leaves will vary depending on the species, with each species exhibiting a characteristic leaf arrangement. Leaves are classified as either alternate, spiral, opposite, or whorled.Leaves can be found in a variety of shapes and sizes. Most leaves are broad, flat and typically green in color. Some plants, such as conifers, have leaves that are shaped like needles or scales. Leaf shape is adapted to best suit the plant's habitat and maximize photosynthesis.Leaves by number. Fibonacci numbers are notorious for appearing in the most unlikely places, including the architecture of plants. Elsewhere in this issue, Didier Reinhardt and colleagues describe ...

P.O. Box 84 Lincoln University Canterbury, New Zealand. Abstract The base temperature (Tb) and thermal time (Tt) requirements for germination and emergence of temperate herbage species were defined using a linear model of development rate against temperature. A Tb of 4°C was found for all species.Instead of accumulating temperatures above 0°C, thermal time systems now use a base or threshold temperature, t base, which varies with species and is estimated as the value that provides the most constant value of k.The base temperatures for shoot emergence were positive and higher than for germination. The base temperature for shoot emergence in English acorns was about 3 °C higher than for Italian acorns (Table 4). The thermal time required for 50 % emergence was about 27 weeks higher for Italian acorns.Relationship between temperature and duration of one generation of a temperate (Meloidogyne hapla, T b = 8.25°C and DD = 554 °C days) and tropical (M. javanica, T b = 12.9°C and DD = 350...Download scientific diagram | Accumulation of above ground biomass as a function of thermal time from emergence (base temperature = 0°C).

The base temperature (T b) and thermal time (Tt) requirements for germination and emergence of temperate herbage species were defined using a linear model of development rate against temperature. A T b of ≤ 4°C was found for all species.The major driving force that pushes wheat through its successive developmental stages from emergence through double ridge, to flowering and maturity is temperature. Development can occur over a range of temperatures; below 0° C is too cold for most varieties and much above 30° C is too hot.All 48 parameterisation data sets that included both sowing date and emergence were used to calculate the median of the temperature sum for this interval, i.e. the value of P9 using a base temperature of 0 °C.Thermal time models were successfully developed for 0, 5, 10 and 15°C temperature amplitudes, using 28 constant and alternating temperature regimes. These models were then modified by linking seed germination in Petri dishes and seedling emergence in soil.We found an optimal temperature for cercarial emergence of 32.0 °C and 33.5 °C for Acanthotrema tridactyla and Cyathocotylidae gen. sp., respectively, which are the warmest recorded thermal ...

Flowering time is of importance in plant breeding as it is central for the adaptation of wheat to different climatic regions and consequently also affects yield potential.Though not significantly different to 8 °C, a base temperature of 8.6–9.4 °C (T b 8.6–T b 9.4) adequately estimated thermal time (TT) durations for the emergence-flowering phase while T b 0 was more satisfactory for estimating grain filling duration.Abstract. We assessed mechanistic temperature influence on flowering by incorporating temperature-responsive flowering mechanisms across developmental age into an existing model. Temperature influences the leaf production rate as well as expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T ( FT ), a photoperiodic flowering regulator that is expressed in ...From an agricultural perspective, increasing ambient temperatures between ∼12°C and 27°C tend to increase photosynthetic capacity, resulting in an overall increase in energy stores and plant biomass ( Bernacchi et al., 2009; Wigge, 2013 ).The authors started their investigation by taking several spring B. napus cultivars to measure their flowering time under optimal (21°C) and high (28°C) temperatures. Most of the tested varieties showed delayed flowering at high temperatures, except for Wesway, which flowered earlier at warmth.The cardinal temperatures describe the response of rate to temperature, where: T b (base temperature) is that temperature at and below which the rate is zero; T o (optimum temperature) is that temperature at which the rate is maximal; and T m, where the rate is again zero.

Instead of accumulating temperatures above 0°C, thermal time systems now use a base or threshold temperature, t base, which varies with species and is estimated as the value that provides the most constant value of k. Using this system, heat sum is calculated from daily temperatures above t base , as indicated by the subscript + in equation 2Pour calculer la valeur du nombre de degrés jour, il faut établir une température de base ( 6 °C pour le maïs ou 0 °C pour le blé par exemple), puis noter les températures maximale et minimale d'une journée.

Here we analyze the distribution and diversity of plant maximum height in relation to climatic gradients for ~ 19,000 Angiosperm species across China. First, we quantify the relationship between the mean maximum height with climatic variables to test the prediction that precipitation and temperature both should restrict the maximum ...The secret behind maximum plant height—water. Physiological coordination between plant height and xylem hydraulic traits is aligned with habitat water availability across Earth's terrestrial ...Plant height is the shortest vertical distance between the upper boundary of the main photosynthetic tissues (excluding inflorescences) on a plant and the stem or shoot base at the ground level, expressed in metres. The maximum plant height (H max) is the maximum length of a typical mature individual of a species in a given habitat.Abstract. Basic engineering theory and empirically determined allometric relationships for the biomass partitioning patterns of extant tree-sized plants show that the mechanical requirements for vertical growth do not impose intrinsic limits on the maximum heights that can be reached by species with woody, self-supporting stems.We hypothesize that flowering phenology correlates with plant height growth pattern and that the pattern is associated with functional traits including maximum plant height ( Hmax ), RGR, stem tissue mass density (SD), hollow ratio (proportion of central hollow of stem cross-sectional area) and leaf mass per area (LMA) in grassland ...We were able to relate r m to maximum plant height for a total of 339 plant species, with a height range of 0.02–110 m. 2.2.3 .

The radiation use efficiency (RUE) of crops is a measure of the conversion of intercepted radiation to biomass. It can be calculated as a function of PAR or solar radiation, using shoots or whole crops, and calculated as the ratio or slope of the regression between biomass and intercepted radiation.This chapter reviews the various aspects of radiation use efficiency (RUE). Topics that are covered include theoretical analyses, experimental determination and measures, and sources of variability. Crop growth rate (dm/dt) could be readily estimated from successive harvests through the growing season. The studies that examined ...The analysis of radiation capture and radiation use efficiency in this study indicates that mixture performance was governed by species dominance within the mixture, with the species capturing most of the light determining to a large extent the radiation use efficiency of the mixture as a whole. Results show the importance of ...Radiation use efficiency is a valuable term to relate biomass accumulation to IPAR; however, the methods to estimate RUE require detailed measurements throughout the growing season. This study was designed to evaluate the use of VIs to measure IPAR throughout the growing season.Radiation use efficiency was highest during rapid growth (2.4 g/MJ) and lower during establishment (1.0 g/MJ) and grain filling (1.3 g/MJ). The low RUE during establishment was associated with a large proportion of leaves exposed to high radiation, and the intrinsically lower efficiency of leaves at saturated light regimes. The low ...Radiation use efficiency is a complex trait, dependent upon both genetic and environmental factors. As the interception of light is so intrinsically tied to productivity and yield, RUE is key target for future improvement. Advances in technology combined with an increased number of studies on light capture and productivity of plants ...The concept of radiation use efficiency (RUE) has been widely used in crop growth analysis. Following the principles of Monteith (1977), aboveground total dry weight (TDW) is expressed as TDW = RAD ⋅ FRI ⋅ RUE, where RAD is the incident radiation and FRI is the fraction of radiation intercepted by the crop. N is a key nutrient limiting crop growth (Sinclair and Horie, 1989). Hence, the ...Radiation Use Efficiency (RUE) defines the productivity with which absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) is converted to plant biomass. Readily used in crop growth models to predict dry matter accumulation, RUE is commonly determined by elaborate static sensor measurements in the field.A simple theoretical derivation of RUE was examined and results indicate that plants grown in glasshouses or in other locations with large fractions of diffuse radiation are likely to have greater radiation-use efficiency than observed under primarily direct radiation.Wheat yields are stagnating or declining in many regions, requiring efforts to improve the light conversion efficiency, known as radiation use efficiency (RUE).

If we compare adult men born in 1996 versus those born a century earlier – men who had reached the age of 18 in 2014 versus 1914 – we see that the global mean height for men increased from 162 to 171 centimeters (cm). We see this in the chart. For women, this increased from 151 cm to 159 cm.The median (50th percentile) growth curves for males and females 0–20 years in the United States The study of height is known as auxology. [11] Growth has long been recognized as a measure of the health of individuals, hence part of the reasoning for the use of growth charts.The pace of growth in height has not been uniform over the past century. The impressive rise in height in Japan stopped in people born after the early 1960s ( Figure 6 ). In South Korea, the flattening began in the cohorts born in the 1980s for men and it may have just begun in women.Growth reference 5-19 years - Height-for-age (5-19 years) When autocomplete results are available use up and down arrows to review and enter to select.Alterations in growth rate. At puberty, a considerable alteration in growth rate occurs. There is a swift increase in body size, a change in shape and composition of the body, and a rapid development of the gonads, or sex glands—the reproductive organs and the characters signalling sexual maturity. Some of these changes are common to both ...Summary The main factor that influences a person’s height is their DNA. However, other factors can influence how tall a person grows during development, including hormones, medical conditions,...The following are some average ranges of weight and height, based on growth charts developed by the CDC: Although a child may be growing, his or her growth pattern may deviate from the norm. Ultimately, the child should grow to normal height by adulthood.The changes in height of the developing child can be thought of in two different ways: the height attained at successive ages and the increments in height from one age to the next, expressed as rate of growth per year. If growth is thought of as a form of motion, the height attained at successive ages can be considered the distance travelled ...A normal growth rate is when height consistently plots on the same percentile on the growth chart, a rate of at least 2 inches per year during childhood. An abnormal slowing in height growth—dropping down percentiles—may trigger a full growth evaluation.General characteristics of height growth patterns in puberty between boys and girls. A total of 13,143 students were included in the cohort study, including 7,729 boys (58.8%) and 5,414 girls (41.2%), 7,729 urban (68.8%) and 5,414 rural children (41.2%). The average follow-up duration was 9.0 ± 1.0 years.

The leaf age index at the turning point varied between sowing dates and cultivars. In FK139, JNK728, and ZD958, the leaf age index at the turning point varied from a minimum of 52.84, 55.20, and 51.5, respectively, to a maximum of 68.50, 68.40, and 67.40, respectively ( Fig. 4 ).The relationship between collared leaf number and growing degree days (GDD) is crucial for predicting maize phenology. Biophysical crop models convert GDD accumulation to leaf numbers by using a constant parameter termed phyllochron (°C-day leaf−1) or leaf appearance rate (LAR; leaf oC-day−1). However, such important parameter values are ...Plant development is controlled by the leaf appearance rate (LAR) and our understanding of how LAR responds to environmental factors is still limited. Here, we tested the hypothesis that carbon availability may account for the effects of irradiance, photoperiod, atmospheric CO 2 concentration, and ontogeny on LAR.Results indicated that new 111-day hybrids produce leaves faster than old hybrids throughout the vegetative phase (7.4% and 3.1% faster before and after the ninth leaf stage, respectively), whereas new 103-day hybrids produce leaves faster only after the ninth leaf stage (9.4%).At 13/8°C, a large proportion of the plants died due to prolonged exposure to cold stress. Both high temperatures and high PPFDs increased leaf-appearance rate. Maximum leaf width was highest at intermediate temperatures and high PPFDs, and was strongly related to specific-leaf weight (R adj2 = 0.88).From the emergence to the V10 stage, leaf collar emergence occurs at ∼29.5 °C d per leaf for upper leaves (the 13 th and higher), and LCA is ∼10 °C d/leaf (Wuethrich, 1997). The leaf-appearance rates are 61.7 °C d per leaf for the first through 12 th leaves and 35.3 °Cd per leaf for the 13 th andThe relationship between collared leaf number and growing degree days (GDD) is crucial for predicting maize phenology. Biophysical crop models convert GDD accumulation to leaf numbers by using a constant parameter termed phyllochron (°C-day leaf -1 ) or leaf appearance rate (LAR; leaf o C-day -1 ).... Although direct measurements are not available for all optimized parameters, a recent 462 study by [50], explored the variability of leaf appearance rate across 98 sites for maize in 463 the...Here, we conducted a series of experiments in the field to quantify and disentangle the effects of sowing date and cultivar on maize leaf collar appearance (LCA). A bilinear model was found to accurately fit maize LCA (R > 0.99); this model revealed a slower rate of LCA for the first leaves compared to the last leaves.The most frequently used hypothesis-testing model is the which assumes a linear leaf appearance process in thermal time, or equivalently a constant rate of leaf appearance, inferred by a linear regression of the times of measurement (in ATT) on the observed number of leaves, for each plant separately [ ].

Above-ground NPP (g dry mass m −2 year −1) was measured using a variety of methods according to the plant functional types present. These types comprised C3 graminoids (Poaceae, Junaceaa, Cyperaceae), broad-leaved and needle-leaved trees, dwarf shrubs, forbs and bryophytes (Table 1 ).The LMA was calculated as the ratio of leaf dry mass and leaf area. The LD was calculated as the ratio of LMA and LVA (leaf thickness) .Characterization of the response in leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA) of plants grown in a range of environmental conditions: (a) daily photon irradiance (DPI); (b) red : far-red ratio (R/FR); (c) UV-B; (d) CO 2 concentration; (e) ozone; (f) nutrient availability; (g) water availability (drought stress); (h) waterlogging; (i ...Trait records for SLA (leaf area per leaf dry mass) were converted to LMA (leaf dry mass per leaf area): LMA = 1/SLA. - Imputation of N massLeaf dry mass per area is generally positively related to both density and thickness, but D and T are not necessarily correlated (Witkowski and Lamont 1991, Garnier and Freijsen 1994, Niinemets 1999b, Wilson et al. 1999), suggesting that control over these variables may be exerted by different mechanisms. According toGLOBAL‐SCALE CLIMATIC CONTROLS OF LEAF DRY MASS PER AREA, DENSITY, AND THICKNESS IN TREES AND SHRUBS - Niinemets - 2001 - Ecology - Wiley Online Library.Here, the authors show that leaf water affects other leaf traits and is a better predictor of whole-leaf photosynthesis and leaf area than leaf nitrogen or phosphorus content.1. Introduction. Leaf dry matter content, also known as the leaf mass per area (LMA), is an indicator of vegetation growing condition. It is defined as the ratio of leaf dry mass to leaf area (unit, g / c m 2), and is widely used a key parameter for studies of terrestrial ecosystem monitoring (Schimel et al., 2015), species identification (Poorter et al., 2009), and fire risk management ...MEASUREMENT OF ABOVE-GROUND NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION Above-ground NPP (g dry mass m 2 year 1) was measured using a variety of methods according to the plant functional types pre-sent. These types comprised C3 graminoids (Poaceae, Junaceaa, Cyperaceae), broad-leaved and needle-leaved trees, dwarf shrubs, forbs and bryophytes (Table 1). All plots ...Many studies have related LMA to gross leaf structure, i.e. to leaf area (LA) and mass (LM), given that LMA = LM/LA, or to leaf thickness (LT) and dry mass density (LD, i.e. dry mass per hydrated volume), given that LMA = LT 9 LD (Witkowski & Lamont 1991; Shipley 1995; Niinemets 1999; Poorter et al. 2009). Gross leaf structure can inﬂuence other

For such, the height and diameter of all trees inside six plots of 100 m2 were measured and used to ...This work deals with the effect of climate (through a single parameter which is humidity), soil (through a single parameter which is phosphorus content), latitude, and species richness on the production of aboveground biomass of 5 different forests.Moisture and humidity dependence of the above-ground cosmic-ray neutron intensity. The novel method of Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) allows non-invasive soil moisture measurements at a hectometer scaled footprint.

We test the performance of two leaf traits – leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA) – as predictors of above-ground NPP (aNPP) across a realistically wide productivity gradient using comprehensive measurements of aNPP comprising the full range of plant functional types that dominate temperate ecosystems.An essential variable in the context of terrestrial carbon fluxes is aboveground biomass (AGB) density, usually defined as the aboveground standing dry mass of live or dead matter, and typically expressed as mass per unit area (e.g. Mg ha −1) for mapped products (Duncanson et al., 2021).Above ground biomass (AGB) is defined as “the aboveground standing dry mass of live or dead matter from tree or shrub (woody) life forms, expressed as a mass per unit area” , typically Mg ha –1. Urban trees can account for up to 97% of urban AGB . AGB can only be directly measured with destructive harvesting, an expensive and ...Swamy, Dutt, Murthy, Mishra, & Bargali (2010) reported that the AGB in tropical evergreen forest of the Western Ghats ranged between 416 and 552.9 t ha −1 that is slightly on higher range compared to the present study.In absolute terms, trees 100 cm in trunk diameter typically add from 10 kg to 200 kg of aboveground dry mass each year (depending on species), averaging 103 kg per year. This is nearly three...Measured aboveground dry mass for individual treatments and growth periods and corresponding logistic functions (see Eq. 1). Aboveground biomass on 15 May 1990 (DM0) was not measured, but was...On the basis of D -based allometry and census data from 23 plots established in the upper Rio Negro region, we estimated a stand-level total biomass (dry mass) of 252.6 Mg ha −1 HighlightsBy integrating our RMF maps with existing aboveground plant biomass information, we estimate that in forests, shrublands and grasslands, respectively, 22%, 47% and 67% of plant biomass exists...The main goals of this study were to initially investigate the effects of plant densities on the aboveground dry matter of corn, and subsequently examine the effects of plant densities on RUE and leaf area index (LAI), and the effects of LAI on RUE. Finally, we provide a comparative assessment of the approaches used to determine RUE.

We found that leaf dry matter content (LDMC) as opposed to specific leaf area (SLA) was the superior predictor of aNPP (R 2 = 0·55). Directly measured in situ trait values for the dominant species improved estimation of aNPP significantly.Leaf mass per area (LMA) is a morphological trait widely used as a good indicator of plant functioning (i.e. photosynthetic and respiratory rates, chemical composition, resistance to herbivory, etc.). The LMA can be broken down into the leaf density (LD) and leaf volume to area ratio (LVA or thickness), which in turn are determined ...Leaf mass per area (LMA) (unit: g m −2) Leaf dry mass per unit of lamina surface area (TOP: leaf mass per area, the ratio of the dry mass of a leaf to its area).Abstract. Leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA) is a product of leaf thickness ( T) and of density ( D ). Greater T is associated with greater foliar photosynthetic rates per unit area because of accumulation of photosynthetic compounds; greater D results in decreased foliage photosynthetic potentials per unit dry mass because of lower ...In this study, we used dry mass-based LWC (i.e. the ratio of leaf water mass to leaf dry mass, g g −1), which was calculated from the fresh mass-based leaf water content or LDMC reported in the ...Relationship between (a) leaf volume per area (LVA) with leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA) and (b) leaf density (LD) with LMA for a number of across-species comparisons. Each functional group from each study is represented by a regression line (following type II regression of Warton et al ., 2006 ).Abstract. Leaf dry mass per unit leaf area (LMA) is a central trait in ecology, but its anatomical and compositional basis has been unclear. An explicit mathematical and physical framework for quantifying the cell and tissue determinants of LMA will enable tests of their influence on species, communities and ecosystems.pin 1997; Suding et al. 2008; Reich 2014). We test the per-formance of two leaf traits – leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and speciﬁc leaf area (SLA) – as predictors of above-ground NPP (aNPP) across a realistically wide pro-ductivity gradient using comprehensive measurements of aNPP comprising the full range of plant functional typesLeaf dry mass per area (LMA) is a leaf morphological trait that has often been used as an indicator of sclerophylly (Gratani and Varone, 2006) and a recent review by Flexas et al. examined the relationship between LMA and g m, summarizing data from 17 studies.We used the relationship between petiole width and leaf mass to estimate leaf dry mass per area (LMA), a leaf functional trait negatively correlated with rate of return-on-investment. We found no evidence for a shift in this leaf-economic trait across the KPB: LMA remained consistent in both its median and overall distribution from ...

The most utilized cover crops in both types of experiments were grasses, representing 43% of researcher experiments and 65% of on-farm experiments. On-farm experiments were more likely to include mixtures (33%) compared to researcher experiments (21%).In the 2019–2020 survey, non-adopters of cover crops reported the following land tenure: 39% owned all the land they farmed, 10.4% owned 76–99, 7.8% owned 51–75, 7.8% owned 26–50, 19.5% owned 1–25, and 15.6% owned none of the land they farmed.On U.S. cropland, the use of cover crops increased by 50 percent between 2012 and 2017. During this same period, Federal and State conservation programs increased efforts to promote cover crops through financial and technical assistance. When farmers introduce cover cropsAlmost half of the arable land (46 %) was covered by normal winter crops. Cover or intermediate crops, plant residues and multi-annual plants occupy shares of 8 %, 7 % and 8 % respectively in arable land. The soil cover on arable land during winter varies among countries.In this Perspective, we estimate land use requirements to supply the United States maize production area with cover crop seed, finding that across 18 cover crops, on average 2.4% (median 2.1%) of ...Here, we studied the impact of four cover crop mixtures varying in species richness and functional diversity, three cover crop termination strategies (i.e. frost, rolling and glyphosate) and two levels of irrigation at the cover crop sowing on soil nitrogen and carbon dynamics, soil microbial diversity and structure as well as the ...Table 5 Linear mixed regression model parameter estimates (SE) for cover crop effects on profit margin ratios across all main crops, grain and oilseed, and vegetable crops from 2007 to 2016 (Sites ...Cover crops are those crops that are planted to increase the health of the soil, reduce the weeds, enhance water availability, help to control pests, prevent sun damage, and slow erosion during periods when a farmer's commercial crops are not being grown there (Niggli, 2015). Cover crops are planted in rotation with other crops and provide needed breaks to land that can lead to increased yield ...In this study, we explore the potential of winter annual legume cover crops to augment soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks within a horticultural cropping system under climate conditions that allow only modest cover crop biomass production.

Thirty-seven percent of ranch parcels had cover crops on at least 5% of the ranch while 22% of ranches had at least one hedgerow/windbreak. Nearly 16% of farmland had other ...

Ground cover plants are also great for covering tricky sites, such as slopes, which are difficult to access and plant. Some can also be grown as an alternative to a lawn. As they cover the soil, ground cover plants are great for suppressing weeds.Ice plant is a perennial succulent ground cover with fleshy leaves and colorful flowers. It gets its name because light reflects off its hairy growths and sparkles on the landscape. It gets its name because light reflects off its hairy growths and sparkles on the landscape.Our top 5 ground cover plants: Hebe pinguifolia ‘Pagei’ AGM; Pachysandra terminalis ‘Variegata’ AGM; Vinca minor ‘Atropurpurea’ AGM; Bergenia ‘Silberlicht’ AGM; Rubus tricolorSide growth: Branches on the side of the plant extend outwards upon contact with the soil. Base growth: New plants produced from the base of the origin plant. Under/Above-ground growth: Produced from rhizomes and stolons; Roots; Like most foliage, groundcover reacts to both natural and anthropogenic disturbances. These responses can ...These plants are sure to enhance your garden without demanding lots of care. 1. Common soapwort. Perhaps the name “soapwort” ( Saponaria officinalis) is not the best name for this gorgeous ground cover plant. From May to September, this perennial blooms with delicate pink and white flower clusters.Ground cover plants are often chosen for aesthetic considerations, such as to introduce new colors or textures into a landscape. Or they can be chosen for practical purposes to cover ground where turf grass does not thrive or is not practical. For example, areas of a yard that are deeply shaded might be a good spot for an alternative ...Best ground cover plants: cover bare soil and save on weeding time with these top picks Include our pick of the best ground cover plants in your garden and you'll add interest to tricky areas of the garden with dense planting that looks good and is easy to care forIn landscaping, ground cover plants usually refers to low-lying plants with a creeping or spreading habit, often evergreen and with twiggy dense growth. But the truth is, any plant that’s no more than three feet at maturity can be regarded as ground cover, especially when planted as a group.Characterized, in part, by how wide-ranging they are, groundcovers can be evergreen or deciduous, low- or tall-growing, clump-forming, trailing, or weeping. But they also share common traits. All groundcovers spread, colonizing areas often relegated to mulch or where turfgrass fears to take hold.

The highest cane yield was recorded in the unsprayed 16-month harvest age treatment, while the highest sucrose yield was recorded in the M + FF ripener combination 12-month harvest age treatment in all the studies. The economic analysis showed the highest marginal rate of return and net revenue in the M + FF ripener combination 12 ...The physical properties of the sugarcane (stalk length and diameter, population density and yield) were measured in the experimental plots in Bundaberg in 2014 and Macknade in 2015 that had...The best results for predicting sugarcane yield by engine parameters were obtained from the RF model with a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 5.6%, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.0 Mg ha−1. The MLR and ANN models have a MAPE of 7.8% and 5.6%, respectively.3.3.1. Cane Yield. Sugar cane varieties and harvesting age had a significant impact on cane yield ton ha-1 month-1 (Table 3). The maximum value of cane yield ton ha-1 month-1 was recorded at the harvesting age of 16 months for both sugarcane varieties. However, the minimum value was found at the harvesting age of 13 months for both ...To determine the profit from harvesting a farm paddock on a particular date, expected cane yield and CCS responses to harvest date were estimated using historical block productivity data for 1992–1998. These data are held for every farm paddock in a mill region.The DSSAT/CANEGRO model was calibrated using published yield parameters from a selection of five Brazilian sugarcane cultivars, while sugarcane yield data (tons of stems per hectare) from commercial land were used as benchmark data. Other modeling inputs were derived from the primary regional cultivar.Using the suggested method, farmers are likely to be advised to harvest their cane slightly either before or after the yield reaches its maximum level. Hence, data regarding declination rate of cane growth are needed to widen search space for mathematical programming.The zone-level yield estimated from plot-level model seems to overestimate than the realized productivity which could be due to some loss factors of crushable biomass in the process of maturity to harvest to transport and delivery at processing unit. The zonal-level reported yield from mill authorities could not be obtained except ...∙ Whole-plant harvesting of energy cane increased biomass yield by 32% or 16 Mg ha−1. ∙ Early harvesting of energy cane reduced biomass yield, sucrose content, and recovered sugar. ∙ Increasing N rate increased stalk and leaf yield but reduced the recovered sugar in energy cane. ∙ N, P, and K removal rates were 2 to 3 times ...Further adding to this discussion, Tanut et al. (2021) reported a new robust tool, viz. the wonder cane model, which correctly forecast total sugarcane harvest yield with an accuracy of 98.69% with fewer estimate errors. The wonder cane model determines the cane yield based on the principle of through data in classification form ...

Agronomic practices to apply existing mineral fertilisers, primarily containing N, P and K, at the right time, the right place, in the right amount, and of the right composition can improve the use efficiency of fertilisers.In order to increase production, more chemical fertilizers are applied to soil, but due to inappropriate application of mineral nutrients, soil degradation, including acidification, secondary salinization, nutrient imbalance, and an abnormal accumulation of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), is common in soils (Cai 2019 ), with sec...Metrics Abstract Nitrogen is the main limiting nutrient after carbon, hydrogen and oxygen for photosynthetic process, phyto-hormonal, proteomic changes and growth-development of plants to complete its lifecycle. Excessive and inefficient use of N fertilizer results in enhanced crop production costs and atmospheric pollution.Fertilizers have played an essential role in feeding a growing global population. It’s estimated that just under half of the people alive today are dependent on synthetic fertilizers. They can bring environmental benefits too: fertilizers can increase crop yields.The advantages of nitrogen fertilizers from the SRF and CRF groups derive from the following features: (i) they ensure a good supply of nitrogen to plants, especially in critical phases; (ii) they reduce the number of application rates; (iii) they reduce the nitrate content in plants; (iv) they limit nitrogen losses and reduce its ...Soil application of fertilizers to calcareous soils is often ineffective, because of their poor physicochemical properties that restrict the availability of nutritional elements to plants. Inefficient soil fertilization leads to nutritional deficiencies in plants, which decrease the yield.The use of combined fertilisation reduced the amount of mineral fertiliser applied between 33 and 67% and the total fertiliser units between 7 and 40%, while maintaining similar yields to the reference mineral fertilisation (180 NFUs). These results could be related to a higher nitrogen agronomic efficiency in the combined ...The results of this research indicate that the application of MSW compost to tomato plants can serve as a N source in Mediterranean conditions, especially when MSW compost is combined with mineral ...We examine numerous cases by varying the quantity of fertiliser applied to the soil and the fertiliser application times. The numerical experiments suggest that, under uniform rainfall rates, the ...Nutrient use efficiency of plants lies around 30–35%, 18–20%, and 35–40% for N, P, and K, respectively, with the conventional fertilizers. The use of biofertilizers in combination or in place of chemical fertilizers could not make much difference.

The EU depends on imports for 30%, 68% and 85% of its consumption of inorganic nitrogen, phosphates and potash nutrients respectively. Furthermore, at the peaks of gas prices during the summer in 2022, gas had come to account for up to 90% of the variable production cost of nitrogen fertilisers.While an increase in nitrogen use efficiency with less fertiliser input leads to an enhanced nitrogen balance (less nitrogen surplus), the replacement of mineral fertilisers by organic fertilisers, which can be less precisely applied and include other substances, may lead to higher nitrogen emissions from the fertiliser application ...The graph shows mineral fertiliser consumption, separately for nitrogen and phosphorus Estimated mineral fertiliser consumption by agriculture in the EU-27, 2008-2018 — European Environment AgencyNitrogen-based fertilisers accounted for the vast majority (77.4 %) of the nutrients consumed, with an estimated consumption of 59 kg per hectare across the EU, ranging from 19 kg per hectare in Portugal to 125 kg per hectare in the Netherlands.In 1965, the consumption of nitrogen fertilizers stood at some 46.3 million metric tons. By 2021, this amount had increased to 195.38 million tons. In that latter year, nitrogen fertilizers ...Mineral fertilizer products The most frequently used straight nitrogen fertilizers are ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulphate, urea and anhydrous ammonia. Seventy to 80 percent of the nitrogen is applied as ammonium nitrate.Harmonized System (HS) with a number of ramifications such as for organic fertilizers (3101) or mineral/chemical fertilizers including nitrogenous 3102, phosphatic 3103, or potassic 31045.

The potassium content of a fertilizer can be calculated with the following formula: % K20 (as expressed on fertilizer bag) .083. = % K in the fertilizer bag.The studies show that there was no reliable reduction in metabolisable energy when agricultural crops were also fertilised annually with lower fertiliser rates of 108 kg ha −1 of nitrogen, 96 kg ha −1 of phosphorus (P 2 O 5 ), and 96 kg ha −1 of potassium (K 2 O).Potassium (K) inputs as a group is the total quantity of K, originating outside a given volume of soil, that moves into that volume (Fig. 2.1). Inputs include K in atmospheric deposition; irrigation water; K transported to the soil volume via runoff and erosion from other areas; K in seeds, cuttings, transplants, or residues; organic ...Our laboratory experiments simulating the addition of fertilisers have shown that the increase in K activity is disproportional to the added amount and constitutes only 2-20% of the respective increase in NO 3 activity ( Table 53 ).Home. Crop production. Nutrient management. Phosphorus and Potassium. Potassium for crop production. Potassium (K) is an essential nutrient for plant growth. It’s classified as a macronutrient because plants take up large quantities of K during their life cycle.This study evaluated the forms of potassium (K+) and quantity-intensity relationships in soils contaminated by tailings around the abundant mica mines. A total of 63 rice rhizosphere soil samples ...Nitrogen fertiliser consumption in agriculture in 2021 was an estimated 9.8 million tonnes in the EU, a year-on-year decrease of 2.0 % that was in line with the short-term trend noted since 2017. However, over the medium-term, the average for “2020” remained slightly higher than that of “2012”.In 2018, the European agricultural sector consumed 10.2 million tonnes of mineral nitrogen (N) fertiliser and 1.1 million tonnes of mineral phosphorus (P) fertiliser . Reducing these numbers by using technologies that valorise biowaste into bio-based fertiliser (BBF) products can stimulate circularity [ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ].

Lime is widely applied as a soil amendment to reduce the grain cadmium (Cd) content in rice production. However, the. effectiveness of liming on grain Cd reduction is inconsistent and often cannot meet the safety requirements established. for rice production. 1) study the effects of lime application on Cd reduction in rice grains among the ...Surface liming effectively increased water-stable aggregates > 2.0 mm at a depth of up to 0.2 m; however, the association with phosphogypsum was considered a good strategy to improve the macroaggregate stability in subsoil layers (0.20 to 0.40 m). Consequently, both soil amendments applied together increased the mean weight diameter ...Liming rate : The average grain Cd reduction rates under lime dosages of >4500 kg/ha, 1500 to 4500 kg/ha, and <1500 kg/ha were −63%, −40%, and −37%, respectively. This suggests that liming at levels >4500 kg/ha would significantly elevate the grain Cd reduction rate compared to smaller dosages. Lime dosages between 1500 andThis paper describes the most popular natural soil amendments used in agriculture which are here divided into two groups: organic amendments (livestock manures, compost, plant residues, slaughterhouse wastes, sewage sludge, biochar) and mineral amendments (volcanic rocks, gypsum, clay minerals, lime, eggshells).The amount of lime applied was multiplied by the emission factor of lime application (i.e., 0.12 CO2-C t lime−1 for CaCO3 (IPCC, 2006, IPCC, 2019), as this type of lime was the most common type used in the experiments and in Western Kenya).Liming combined with an optimum quantity of inorganic fertilizer, as a soil amendment in intensive agriculture, is a viable agricultural practice in terms of improving soil nutrient status and productivity, as well as mitigating soil degradation. The chief benefits of this strategy are fundamentally dependent on soil microbial function.The most commonly applied amendments include liming materials, phosphates, minerals, and industrial by-products. Here for simplicity we have initially classified immobilizing agents into either organic or inorganic types and briefly discussed their appropriateness for in situ soil remediation below ( Fig 3 ).Whether applied to tropical soil, lime has been proven to have beneficial effects on the quantity and community composition of virtually all kinds of soil organisms .

Pure water has a pH value of 7.00 at 25 ºC; however, samples are especially prone to CO 2 absorption from the atmosphere, which alters the pH from the expected value of 7.00 toward 5.20 due to carbonic acid formation. To minimize this effect, METTLER TOLEDO recommends pH readings in a flow-through cell.It is relatively easy to test the pH level of water and here we will discuss in detail three ways to achieve an accurate pH water test: Using a pH meter; Using pH papers; Using litmus...- the theory and practice of laboratory pH applications 1 pH Booklet Master 25/5/99 10:57 pm Page 1 . This guide to pH measurement has been produced to accompany the latest development in laboratory pH technology. As well as an insight into the theoretical aspects of pH measurement, sections covering applications and electrode troubleshooting have been included to make this a comprehensive ...The pH value is one of the most important and most frequently measured quantities in analytical chemistry. A pH measuring instrument is always needed when the pH reading must be determined accurately. An appropriate pH meter is available in virtually every laboratory.Part A: Using Indicators to Measure pH. In this part of the experiment you will use five indicators to determine the pH of four solutions to within one pH unit. An acid-base indicator is a chemical species that changes color at a specific pH as the pH (acidity) of the solution is varied.The pH of surface water is a common field measurement. This measurement can be made using a Thermo ScientificTM OrionTM ROSSTM UltraTM TriodeTM which will measure both the temperature and pH of the sample with a single probe. The probe provides quick, reproducible results in both fresh and salt water samples.The pH of water is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion activity, which is often assimilated to the hydrogen ion concentration (Eq. [1], Table 1). While the pH of pure water is approximated to be 7.0 at 25 °C, the theoretical value is 6.998. Indeed, the dissociation of water and the ionic product for water (Eqs.The reaction of ammonia with water. The whole scale of pH values in aqueous solutions includes both the acidic and alkaline ranges. The values can vary from 0 to 14, where pH values from 0 to 7 are called acidic and pH values from 7 to 14 are termed alkaline. The pH value of 7 is neutral. We measure pH for a lot of different reasons, such as:In general there are three major categories of pH meters. Benchtop pH meters are often used in laboratories and are used to measure samples which are brought to the pH meter for analysis. Portable, or field pH meters, are handheld pH meters that are used to take the pH of a sample in a field or production site. [19]

The numerical difference in the values of pH measured in 1 M KCl and H 2 O (pH KCl – pH H 2O) is referred to as the delta pH. When this difference is negative, the colloid has a net negative charge (cation exchange capacity), and when positive, it has a net positive charge (anion exchange capacity).In this paper, the pH of CO 2-saturated aqueous KCl solutions was measured over wide ranges of temperature and pressure and at salt molalities of 2 mol·kg −1 and 4 mol·kg −1. The range of conditions investigated covers those relevant to CO 2 storage in deep saline aquifers.pH (KCl) The pH-value in a suspension of sample material and a diluted potassium solution corresponds to the potential acidity. The hydrogen-cations adsorbed to the sample constituents are replaced by potassium cations and are therefore measurable in the suspension. The resulting pH is about 0.3-1.0 units lower compared to the pH in a ...KCl is useful as a beta radiation source for calibration of radiation monitoring equipment, because natural potassium contains 0.0118% of the isotope 40 K. One kilogram of KCl yields 16350 becquerels of radiation , consisting of 89.28% beta and 10.72% gamma , with 1.46083 MeV.A summary of the data used in this study is shown in Table 1 and the frequency distribution plots are shown in Fig. 1. pH values were highest in water, followed by CaCl 2 and lastly in KCl. In general, pH values measured in water and in KCl increased with increase in solution volume, this as a result of the dilution effect. Thomas ...In this study, pH was measured in different electrolytes [distilled water (pH(w)), 0.01 M CaCl2 (pH(ca)), 1 M KCl (pH(k)), and 0.01 M BaCl2 (pHba)] with different soil : solution ratios (i.e. 1 : ...Then, fill up with 3 M KCl. Differences in the concentration of the electrolyte solution lead to differences in the measured potential and therefore influence the measured ph value. What do I do if an electrode is dried out?

After this ...The pH value is defined, by the Sorenson Equation, as the negative logarithm of the H+ concentration in a given solution (see table 1). In other words, at a high concentration, e.g. 1 mol/L = 10 0 , pH = 0 (ACIDIC)The pH values measured in salt solutions were significantly lower than that of distilled water; average pH CaCl 2 and pH KCl were 0.61 and 0.78 pH units lower than pH H 2 O, respectively.of the soil buffering effect. Acidity known as “extractable” is measured at pH 8.2 with a BaCl 2–triethanolamine reagent, and its measurement can be combined with that of charges that depend on the pH. 23.1.2 Aims of the Analysis For soil taxonomy, the 1 mol (KCl) L−1 extract is considered to include only exchangeable forms Al3+, AlOH2 ...

Nitrogen Determination in Soil. The Dumas method starts with a combustion furnace (CF) to burn the sample, obtaining elemental compounds. Water is removed by a first physical trap (WT1 - DriStepTM), placed after the combustion, and a second chemical one (WT2).Nitrogen balance is measured by deducting N outputs and changes in soil total N storage from N inputs [1], [2] as follows: Nitrogen balance = N inputs − N outputs − changes in soil total N (1)This technique uses an Elementar vario MAX cube to determine the total N in the soil. It is based on the method originally described by Dumas and later modified by Sweeny (1989). It operates on the principle of quantification of N2 and CO2 after the total combustion of a 250-350 mg* sample at 900°C in an oxygen and helium rich atmosphere.The UMS framework can be used to estimate the total nitrogen in soil. However, depending on the types of soil and crops, the model needs to be re-calibrated. More specifically, the actual TN of ...The analysis of total nitrogen in an organic matrix can be carried out using the Dumas method (1831). This involves a total combustion of the matrix under oxygen. The gases produced are reduced by copper and then dried, while the CO2 is trapped. The nitrogen is then quantified using a universal detector.ISO 13878 Soil quality - Determination of total nitrogen content by dry combustion („elemental analysis“) EN 13654-2 Soil improvers and growing media - Determination of nitrogen – part 2: Dumas method 2 Scope and working area This standard descibes the determination of total nitrogen (organic and inorganic)In analytical chemistry, the Dumas method is a method of elemental analysis for the quantitative determination of nitrogen in chemical substances based on a method first described by Jean-Baptiste Dumas in 1826.The Dumas method is an elemental analysis for nitrogen determination and it is globally recognised and validated by international organisations such as AOAC, AACC, ISO, DIN, ASBC, AOCS or OIV. In addition to the organic nitrogen content, the combustion method can also be used to analyse the total nitrogen content including inorganic components.Abstract. Dry combustion based on the Dumas (1831) method has become increasingly popular for total nitrogen (N) and isotope‐ratio analyses. However, the lack of sample homogeneity with soil and plant samples is often the limiting factor for the accuracy and precision of this method.Soil improvers and growing media - Determination of nitrogen - Part 2 : Dumas method Le présent document décrit une méthode de détermination de l'azote présent dans les amendements du sol et les supports de culture.

SUMMARY Why the Olsen method should he used to estimate « available soil pho.sporus » After "PO, labelling of the isotopically exchangeable phosphate ions of soils, « available soil phosphorus » was extracted by different chemical reagents used for soil routine analysis, i.e. sodium bicarbonate for the OLSENSummary. This method estimates the relative bioavailability of inorganic ortho-phosphate (PO4-P) in soils with neutral to alkaline pH. It is not appropriate for soils which are mild to strongly acidic (pH <6.5). The method is based on the extraction of phosphate from the soil by 0.5 N sodium bicarbonate solution adjusted to pH 8.5.La méthode permettant d’extraire de la terre du phosphore dont la composition isotopique est la plus voisine de celle des ions de la solution est jugée la plus intéressante.

Soil Olsen P is generally a good indicator to estimate bio-availability of P and environmental risk in alkaline soil. The change in Olsen P is always strongly affected by soil organic carbon (SOC) when different forms of inorganic and ...Summary. Methods for determining soil phosphorus (P), its various forms and availability to plants, have been essential in developing principles and knowledge of the nature and behavior of P in soils. The selection of a suitable method demands a clear statement of objectives that require the soil P measurement.The correlation of Mehlich 3 P and Olsen P methods, excluding soils with pH less than 5 and soils with calcium carbonate levels from 10.3 to 48.3%, resulted in a linear slope of 0.24 and r 2 of 0.82, and thus for this range of soils the Mehlich 3 test provided a more reliable measurement of P compared to the Olsen method. This study confirms ...tractor type and pH value, and their reliability depends on the soil type (Reijneveld et al., 2010). The Olsen method (Olsen et al., 1954) is used for soils with mildly acid, neutral or alkaline pH, and it has wide international acceptance as an indicator of soil P fertility (Bierman & Rosen, 1994; Ma et al., 2009; Pagliari et al., 2010 ...

CEC affects many aspects of soil chemistry, and is used as a measure of soil fertility, as it indicates the capacity of the soil to retain several nutrients (e.g. K +, NH 4 +, Ca 2+) in plant-available form. It also indicates the capacity to retain pollutant cations (e.g. Pb 2+).Soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) is often used as an important indicator of soil fertility and buffer capacity. Biochar can provide stronger adsorption capacity and greater porosity, increase the soil’s adsorption capacity for mineral elements and the value of CEC ( Liang et al., 2006 ).Cation exchange capacity ( CEC) is a measure of the soil’s ability to hold positively charged ions. It is a very important soil property influencing soil structure stability, nutrient availability, soil pH and the soil’s reaction to fertilisers and other ameliorants (Hazleton and Murphy 2007).Cation Exchange Capacity (clay) - Subsoil. Cation-exchange capacity (CEC) is the maximum quantity of total cations that a soil is capable of holding, at a given pH value, available for exchange with the soil solution. CEC is used as a measure of fertility, nutrient retention capacity, and the capacity to protect groundwater from cation ...This is the first report of a comparison of CEC values obtained by the buffered CEC (NH 4 OAC), BaCl 2 (single extraction), compulsive exchange, AgTU, and Cohex methods for a single soil sample set. We found that AgTU, compulsive exchange, and Cohex methods yielded similar eCEC values.The lowest mean CEC values were found in Spain and the highest mean values were found in the agricultural soils of Iran (38.89 cmol/kg) and Iraq (36.7 cmol/kg), followed by CEC values in forest lands (37.55 cmol/kg) in Iran (Table 1).Cation exchange capacity (CEC) characterizes soils by their ability to store and release nutrients. Cationic nutrients (Ca, Mg, K, Na, Fe, and NH 4 ) and non-nutrients (Al and H) are held on soil colloids and transported to the soil solution in an ion exchange reaction (Weil & Brady, 2016 ).CEC of a soil is dependent on the amount and type of soil colloids, clay minerals, and soil organic matter. It also reflects the total negative charge exchange sites on soil colloids ( Follett, 2001 ) and increases correspondingly with pH, % clay, and % organic matter content.Relationship between effective cation exchange capacity (CEC eff.) and soil organic carbon (SOC) content in (A) topsoils (0–30 cm depth) with soil pH < 5.5, (B) topsoils with soil pH > 5.5, (C) subsoils (30–120 cm depth) with soil pH < 5.5 and (D) subsoils with soil pH > 5.5.CEC. What is cation exchange capacity? Cation exchange capacity (CEC) indicates the ability of a soil to hold onto and exchange cations (positively charged ions) including plant nutrients such as Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and NH 4 +. The CEC is largely depend on clay content, organic matter and soil pH. CEC is a very important soil property

For the method, a silver–thiourea exchange solution is saturated with Ca 2+ by treatment with fine-grained calcite prior to the start of the exchange procedure.The main ions associated with CEC in soils are the exchangeable cations calcium (Ca 2+), magnesium (Mg 2+), sodium (Na +) and potassium (K +) (Rayment and Higginson 1992), and are generally referred to as the base cations.Summary statistics of measured soil (a) exchangeable calcium (Exch. Ca - cmol(+)/kg) and (b) exchangeable magnesium (Exch. Mg - cmol(+)/kg) for calibration and validation and at various sample size (n).Analytical methods assessment for exchangeable cations analysis in soil: MIP OES appraisement. Soil monitoring and research often requires a comparison of laboratory data generated by diverse instruments and in different laboratories to demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of the results.Cation exchange capacity (CEC) is one of the fundamental properties of soil that indicates soil’s ability to retain exchangeable cations. Several regression-based models exist to estimate CEC from widely available or easily measured basic soil properties. However, the majority of these models do not include CaCOThe aims of this study were to investigate the links between potassium (K) uptake by crops and soil K, exchangeable calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), and aluminum (Al3+) when using lime in acidic soil in southern China. Soil samples of three treatments (chemical NP fertilizers, NPK, and NPK plus straw (NPKS)) were collected from a 26 ...gives satisfactory results with soils containing no calcium carbonate. In the Gedroiz method it is assumed that in carbonate-free soils, 0-05 N HC1 does not attack unweathered mineral particles present in the soil, and that only exchangeable calcium is brought into solution, so that the same figure for exchangeable calcium should be obtained by theAlternatively, the amount of exchangeable nutrients can be estimated from agronomic soil tests (Astera, 2015; Sumner & Miller, 1996). If CEC is included in a routine soil test, farmers and advisors can use it to assess soil texture (Weil & Brady, 2016 ), plan gypsum applications (NRCS, 2015 ), and evaluate nutrient availability (Chaganti & Culman, 2018 ).

As a rule of thumb, for most crops in Cerrado soils the ratio between the levels of exchangeable Ca 2+ and exchangeable Mg 2+ (in cmol c /dm 3) in the soil should stay in the range of 1:1 till a maximum of 10:1, observing a minimum of 0.5 cmol c Mg 2+ dm −3 ( Sousa and Lobato, 2004a ).Magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca) and potassium (K) are three major and essential nutrients for plants 1. In forest ecosystems, their plant-available pools are assumed to be stored in the soil as...Mg Mg = 0.16‰) are all isotopically lighter than the basalt. These compositions can be explained by a combination of mixing and isotope fractionation processes on the soil exchange complex.Due to high variation in Mg content of the source material the total content of Mg in soils varies considerably between 0.05 and 0.5 % (Grimme 1991; Maguire and Cowan 2002 ). Differences in silicate contents of soils also explain higher Mg contents typically found in clay and silty soils compared to sandy soils.A ratio of magnesium-to-calcium > 1 in irrigation waters and an exchangeable magnesium percentage > 25% in soils are considered high enough to result in soil degradation and impact crop yields negatively.Soil pH directly affects magnesium release from clay minerals and Mg uptake by plants (Schubert et al., 1990). Exchangeable Mg at pH <6.0 becomes non-exchangeable when soil pH becomes higher than 6.5 (Chan et al., 1979; Hailes et al., 1997).Extract.

Exchangeable sodium percentage is worldwide considered to be probably the most important soil factor affecting dispersion in soils and, consequently, soil crusting. It has also in several South African studies been found to be one of the most dominant factors in soil crusting.The best indicator of soil sodicity is the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP). The ESP is usually defined as the ratio of exchangeable sodium (Exch Na) to the cation exchange capacity of the soil (CEC), both expressed in (cmolc kg −1) ( Richards, 1954 ). ESP = ExchNa CEC ∗ 100.Soil exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) are commonly used to assess soil sodicity.

In the case of N, it is also important to assess the system's ability to recycle the nutrient contained in the leaves and canes which amounted to 49.4 kg N ha −1.The amount of potassium contained in nodes and dry leaves of sugarcane ranges around 70 kg per ha and may reach 140 kg per ha in plant cane . Tables 6–8 present the recommendations of potassium fertilization for plant cane and regrowth, with Mehlich or ion exchange resin as extractors.Potassium (K) is the most abundant cation accumulating in the cell sap of sugarcane plant. A healthy sugarcane crop indeed contains generally more than 200 kg K ha–1 in its aerial parts. Though in the absence of an adequate K supply, leaf area, tiller density and number of green leaves per mother shoot may notPotassium concentration in the leaf (A), tip (B) and culm (C) of sugarcane (caneplant), RB92579 variety, according to the days after planting Source publication +2 NITROGEN, PHOSPHORUS AND...Sugarcane ( Saccharum officinarum) is grown in more than ninety countries in the world and occupies about 26.26 m ha area with production of 1907.0 m tones at 72.59 t/ha productivity (FAO 2018 ). India ranks second after Brazil in area (5.11 m ha) and total sugarcane production (400.16 m tones) at 78.3 t ha −1 productivity level (DAC 2019 ).Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the agronomic performance of PYH in both cane plant and ratoon as a multi-nutrient source for sugarcane on a low-K Entisol contrasting with a single K fertilizer source (potassium chloride) combined with Ca, Mg and S sources (phosphogypsum and kieserite).Abstract. Potassium (K) is one of three main crop nutrients, and the high rate of potash fertilizer utilization (second only to nitrogen) leads to high prices. Therefore, efficient application, as well as rapid and time monitoring of K in crops is essential. Several turnover box and field experiments were conducted across multiple ...Potassium has diverse role in plant growth and development. • Potassium is responsible for activation of several vital plant enzymes. • Potassium regulate water balance in plants and protect plants from abiotic stress-induced damages. • Potassium plays a vital role in mitigating oxidative stress in plants.Potassium treatments (0, 100, 200 and 300 kg K ha −1, as KCl) resulted in significant (P < .001) increases in leaf K concentrations, along with relatively consistent increases in sugarcane and sucrose yields with increasing leaf K. Increased leaf K concentrations led to decreases in leaf calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg).The chapter explores the role of major nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and minor nutrients such as copper, zinc, manganese, in the physiology of sugarcane and the consequences of nutrient excess for physiology, crop quality, and the environment.

Potassium treatments (0, 100, 200 and 300 kg K ha −1, as KCl) resulted in significant (P < .001) increases in leaf K concentrations, along with relatively consistent increases in sugarcane and sucrose yields with increasing leaf K. Increased leaf K concentrations led to decreases in leaf calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg).Calcium (Ca) is a unique macronutrient with diverse but fundamental physiological roles in plant structure and signalling.

Though the ICUMSA method is accurate and...Sugar cane is composed mainly of sucrose, fibre and water, usually in the proportions of about 12%, 15% and 70%, respectively (Anon., 2007), in Mauritius. The remaining constituents are other sugars (glucose and fructose), inorganic materials, nitrogenous substances, gums, waxes and organic acids (Chen and Chou, 1993).Brix is the percentage of the total content of soluble solids in the juice. Pol is also known as sucrose juice, and it is the apparent sugar content in the juice. Fibre is the percentage of water-insoluble matter of cane and bagasse, and all of the other parameters (purity, cane pol, RS, and TRS) are calculated based on the former ...The ratio of fibre to cane is commonly expressed as a percentage and is known as fibre-%. This is defined as It = CFt x 100 (%), (2) t where it is the value of fibre-%.

Purity drop has been reported in sugarcane deterioration by Datir and Joshi ...For instance, the purity of sugarcane, which can be derived from Brix and Pol values, is an important factor that determines the level of degradation of harvested cane during the cut-to-crush time, which indicates the efficiency of sugar production.In many countries, representative cane samples are taken, and detailed analyses for Brix, pol and purity are made in the laboratory. The common practice, however, is to test the standing cane in the field for Brix with a hand refractometer, which is an approximate measure of the amount of sucrose in the juice and/or cane. To obtain the Brix, a ...The paper analyzes the dynamic laws of five quality indexes (i.e., brix, purity, polarization, sucrose content,... | Sugarcane, Juice and Sugar | ResearchGate, the professional network for scientists.CC 85-92, used during the trial, had an average pol % cane of 14.5% purity and fiber % cane of 91.5% and 17.0%, respectively (Table 1). Similar results were observed for manually harvested cane (average pol % cane of 14.6 %) when cane was delivered to the factory, despite a residence time of 48 hours on fieldThere is a real need to establish new criteria to measure deterioration in Louisiana harvested cane, in order to better predict: 1) the quality of the cane to be processed, and 2) the...

Primary and secondary losses in harvested canes begin with primary losses related to direct impact on sucrose content in a natural way, while secondary losses are related to the production of secondary products and metabolites such as acids, dextran, and other substances that affect sugar recovery. In the sugar industry, the ...Based on the results, our study illustrated that the sucrose content was reduced to 1.26 units along with reduction in commercial cane sugars of 1.42 units. This is due to reduction in increase in reducing sugars, dextran, soluble acid invertase and microbial infestation in drought canes after 240 h of harvest. Furthermore, this ...The reduction in sucrose content over the time following cane har- vest results in low sugar recovery, reducing mills ’ economies, making post-harvest losses a topic to consider and comprehend.PDF | Sucrose losses after the harvest of sugarcane and (luring subsequent milling operation are one of the most serious problems in many sugar... | Find, read and cite all the research you need ...The quick loss of sucrose content in sugarcane from the time it is harvested has a significant impact on sugar recovery. This problem of post-harvest sucrose losses in sugarcane is a serious concern in cane-producing countries, as it not only leads to low sugar recovery in mills, but also to poor sugar refining.Effect of post-harvest sucrose losses in sugarcane a & b: Loss in sucrose content in normal and drought grown canes at an equal interval of 48 after harvest from 0 h till 240 h after harvest.Sugarcane contains high concentrations of sucrose, providing a favorable environment for the proliferation of microorganisms, which can invade the harvested sugarcane stalk through wounds or cuts . Studies have shown that more than 400 species of bacteria and fungi may be present in cuts and wounds after sugarcane harvesting [ 10 ].The crushing of harvested cane is often delayed for longer than 72 h leading to a steep decline in sucrose content, especially late in the harvest season when ambient temperatures are high. The average reductions in Commercial Cane Sugar (CCS) in untreated billets and whole cane during late harvest were 0.735 and 0.502 units/day ...Sucrose inversions in the deterioration of harvested cane result from the chemical (acid), enzymic inversion, and microbial activity. In the first 14 h of cane juice deterioration, 93.0% of sucrose losses are caused by microbial, 5.7% by enzymic, and 1.3% by chemical changes (acid degradation) .To improve yield and other traits of interest for the development of an energy cane, research must unravel the complexities of the sugarcane genome, develop statistical genetics for highly polyploid genomes and identify genes associated with sucrose content, drought resistance, biomass and cell wall recalcitrance.

With a full PGR programme (applied during early and late stem extension), benchmark stem heights (to the highest ligule/collar or base of the ear) are: GS31 = 9 cm (related to leaf sheath length) GS39 = 34 cm (around 50% of final height)Pseudo-stem (formed by sheaths of leaves) strongly erected. Stem Extension 6: First node of stem visible at base of shoot. 7: Second node of stem formed; next-to-last leaf just visible. 8: Flag leaf (last leaf) visible but still rolled up; ear beginning to swell. 9: Ligule of flag leaf just visible. 10Feekes 9.0: Ligule of Flag Leaf Visible (early May) Stage 9.0 begins when the flag leaf is fully emerged from the whorl with the ligule visible (Figure 5). From this point on, leaves are referred to in relation to the flag leaf (i.e., the first leaf below the flag leaf is the F-1, the second leaf below is the F-2, and so forth).Figure 19.5. Parts of the grass leaf: ligule. In some species, the leaf blade will show distinct veins when held against the light as seen in meadow fescue. Other important characteristics include stem base colouration which are red/pink in the ryegrasses. Stem/root features can be important when identifying non-sown grass species.Spike growth, slow in its early stages, increases greatly about the time the ligule of the flag leaf becomes visible (Krumm et al., 1990). Floret abortion starts in the boot stage and finishes at anthesis. Floret death occurs when the stem and peduncle are at maximum growth rate (Siddique et al., 1989). Floret death is probably, at least ...The microphylls of Lycopodiophyta of the families Selaginellaceae (spikemosses or lesser clubmosses) and Isoetaceae (quillworts) have minute, scale-like flaps of tissue called ligules at the base of the upper surface of each leaf blade. This feature distinguishes them from clubmosses of the family Lycopodiaceae.

In agroecosystems where crops are planted in a specific design (row crops), sampling procedures for...In this study, we aimed to explore which regression models and phenotypic traits derived from lidar data are best for estimating maize biomass (not biomass density) at four levels, including plot, individual plant, leaf group, and individual organ (i.e., individual leaf or stem) levels.Shoot (or above-ground) biomass (W S) is commonly measured by clipping the vegetation at ground level from randomly selected quadrats, while root (or below-ground) biomass (W R) is extracted from cores or trenches. The area under study should be divided into a number of equal squares or rectangular plots with areas of, for example, 1 ...Biomass is an important measure of ecosystem productivity and is highly related to ecosystem structure and function ( Lohbeck et al., 2015 ). About 90% of the total aboveground biomass (AGB) of the terrestrial ecosystem is stored within forests ( Dixon et al., 1994; Guo et al., 2010 ).Root biomass is one of the most relevant root parameters for studies of plant response to environmental change, soil carbon modelling or estimations of soil carbon sequestration. A major source of error in root biomass quantification of agricultural crops in the field is the presence of extraneous organic matter in soil: dead roots ...We tested equations developed using data from 11 environmental and mallee planting sites where direct measurements of root biomass were made through whole-plot excavation. Site-level predictions of root biomass from individual tree allometry were effective, with an efficiency of prediction of 0.98. These results indicate that the ...

Step 10: Extrapolate the dry weight of the biomass to per hectare and stratum level: ° First, e xtrapolate according to individual tree and species at the plot level. ° Second, extrapolate for the whole plot. ° Third, extrapolate to per hectare.Direct measurement of the AGB of a tree requires that the tree be harvested and weighed to determine the total dry biomass of all its aboveground components.Whilst a wide range of different methodologies have been used for determining tree biomass in native forests, a consistent methodology for above and belowground biomass estimates in commercial plantations is less well developed and have focused on temperate eucalypts [9].The plot measurement and biomass sampling procedures at Oxford and d’Urville allowed live biomass stocks to be estimated in 2008 and 2012. The measured stock changes were similar to stock changes predicted, using backcasting methods, from stem analysis of basal disc samples from representative shrubs growing adjacent to each plot.We compared biomass estimates for individual trees, plots, and at the landscape-scale using our locally-developed allometric equations, nationwide equations applied across the U.S., and the Forest Inventory and Analysis Component Ratio Method (FIA-CRM).The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of multispectral LiDAR data for the reliable estimation of single-tree total and barkless stem biomass (TSB and BSB) in an uneven-aged structured forest with complex topography.Direct measurement of the AGB of a tree requires that the tree be harvested and weighed to determine the total dry biomass of all its aboveground components. Although this method can produce highly accurate results when performed carefully, given its destructive nature and the huge effort required, it cannot be used to produce estimates for large quantities of trees (Goldbergs et al., 2018 ...

In another study in the USA, the highest theoretical ethanol yields for sweet sorghum averaged 10,616 and 11,408 L ha −1 in 2005 and 2006, respectively (Bonin et al. 2016 ).

The average field-derived fresh shoot mass, fruit numbers, and yield mass for all plants remaining at harvest was 715.29, 532.06, and 226.96 g, respectively, whereas those for the control plants were 1070.67, 810.00, and 362.55 g, respectively, while those of the salt-treated plants were 355.56, 241.89, and 87.47 g, respectively.Sweet sorghum has succulent stems and broth similar to sugarcane, but studying its energy potential is necessary. We evaluated the biomass, grain yield, ethanol production, and energy cogeneration of sweet sorghum cultivars irrigated with raw and diluted domestic sewage effluent.This equation can deal with long time scales (i.e. the whole crop cycle) provided that values of RUE, k and LAI are dynamically updated. When the ratio of harvestable biomass to the total biomass (harvest index, HI) of a plant is considered, the yield of a crop can then be formalized as follows:The major processes simulated in crop models include crop phenological development and dry mass growth, leaf area development, light interception and utilisation, crop demand for water and nutrients, yield formation, dynamics of soil water, carbon, and nitrogen (N), evapotranspiration, and the effect of atmospheric carbon dioxide ...To test for functional plant traits related to the harvest index of crops when neighbour diversity increased, we quantified differences in plant interaction intensity and plant functional traits ...ANE applications improved plant growth (plant height, stem diameter, fresh and dry mass of leaf, stem and root, leaf number, leaf area, root length and chlorophyll content), yield components (fruit quantity, fruit weight and size, bunches number and size and productivity), as well as soil fertility (dynamics of macronutrients and organic carbon).Fresh and dry weight of roots under FA treatment were highest, which were 37.31% and 47.00% higher than those under the CK treatment, respectively .

A TST in sugar beet, BvTST2.1, was recently demonstrated to function as an H + /sucrose antiporter that transports sucrose into the vacuoles and is responsible for sugar accumulation in taproot, which is the storage organ in sugar beet (Jung et al., Citation 2015).Tissue was sampled six hours after the beginning of the light period. Soluble sugars were extracted from 50 mg of frozen powder by two successive additions of 80% ethanol kept for 2 h in ice. The supernatants were then separated from the residual solid material, evaporated with a speed-vac, and re-suspended in 50 µL of water ...Although no direct measurements have been made in sugarcane, the 14 CO 2 studies of Hartt et al. (1963) indicate that sucrose is the major carbohydrate transported in the phloem. In the sink tissues, sucrose is unloaded from the phloem. Several pathways of unloading have been described ( Patrick, 1997 ).Sweet sorghum has emerged as a promising source of bioenergy mainly due to its high biomass and high soluble sugar yield in stems. Studies have shown that loss-of-function <i>Dry</i> locus alleles have been selected during sweet sorghum domestication, and decapitation can further boost sugar accumul …Roots of sugar beet and stems of sugarcane and sweet sorghum are the primary tissues to accumulate high levels of sugars, mainly sucrose. These tissues are sink tissues receiving photosynthetic products from source tissues through phloem transport.More importantly, our results demonstrated that the phenotype of high sugar content is inheritable and shed light on improvement for other sugar crops.Additionally, some studies showed that SWEET transporters perform their functions in the stem. In this study, the quantitative expression of SlSWEETs in the tomato stem during mature green (MG) and RR stages were analyzed. We found that SlSWEET11b (Solyc03g097570) had the highest overall expression level in the stem.Sugars, especially glucose and fructose, contribute to the taste and quality of tomato fruits.

This paper proposes an efficient method to extract the leaf region and count the number of leaves in digital plant images.region growing, the noise in segmentation is suppressed and labeled leaf centers can expand to their whole leaves, respectively. Our method can work on point clouds generated from three types of 3D imaging platforms, and also suitable for different kinds of plant species. In experiments, it obtainsEach leaf typically has a leaf blade ( lamina ), stipules, a midrib, and a margin. Some leaves have a petiole, which attaches the leaf to the stem; leaves that do not have petioles are directly attached to the plant stem and are called sessile leaves.In most plants, stems are located above the soil surface, but some plants have underground stems. Stems have several main functions: Support for and the elevation of leaves, flowers, and fruits. The stems keep the leaves in the light and provide a place for the plant to keep its flowers and fruits.Leaves are generally composed of a few main parts: the blade and the petiole. Figure 13.1.2 13.1. 2: A leaf is usually composed of a blade and a petiole. The blade is most frequently the flat, photosynthetic part. The petiole is a stem that attaches the leaf blade to the main stem of the plant.We identify this as a joint multi-leaf segmentation, alignment, and tracking problem. First, leaf segmentation and alignment are applied on the last frame of a plant video to ﬁnd a number of well-aligned leaf candidates. Second, leaf tracking is applied on the remaining frames with leaf candidate transformation from the previous frame.A leaf (pl.: leaves) is a principal appendage of the stem of a vascular plant, usually borne laterally aboveground and specialized for photosynthesis.Leaves are collectively called foliage, as in "autumn foliage", while the leaves, stem, flower, and fruit collectively form the shoot system. In most leaves, the primary photosynthetic tissue is the palisade mesophyll and is located on the upper ...Typically, a leaf consists of a broad expanded blade (the lamina), attached to the plant stem by a stalklike petiole. In angiosperms leaves commonly have a pair of structures known as stipules, which are located on each side of the leaf base and may resemble scales, spines, glands, or leaflike structures. Leaves are, however, quiteThe top one, the apical meristem, accounts for growth in the stem. The lower one, the intercalary meristem, produces leaf primordia. The leaf primordia eventually divides into two systems that develop leaf blades and leaf sheaths. Growth of leaf blades begins with cells dividing but eventually is mainly from cell elongation. The pacing of leaf ...

Impact of soluble sugar concentrations on the acquisition of freezing tolerance in accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana with contrasting cold adaptation – evidence for a role of raffinose in cold acclimation - KLOTKE - 2004 - Plant, Cell & Environment - Wiley Online Library.In today's context, the survival of plants under environmental stress is an extensive area of research. In addition, increase in the concentration of soluble sugars such as, glucose, sucrose and fructose enhances plant tolerance to several abiotic stresses, such as drought, salinity and cold (Rathinasabapathi, 2000).Sensing intracellular soluble sugar pathways, however, provides incomplete information about the metabolic status of plant cells, since they ignore the concentration of soluble sugars in the apoplast and, perhaps more importantly, the apoplast-cytosol and the vacuole-cytosol fluxes of sugars. Consequently, a complex signalling network underlying to sugar-sensing pathways is present.The content and the ratio of soluble sugars and organic acids in fruits are significant indicators for fruit quality. They are affected by multiple environmental factors, in which water-deficient is the most concern. Previous studies found that the content of soluble sugars and organic acids in fruit displayed great differences under ...Soluble sugars are metabolic substrates that play a fundamental role in controlling several processes in diverse plant developmental phases. Sugars such as glucose, sucrose and fructose are reported throughout the plant kingdom and have a dominant role in structure and metabolism at the cellular and whole-plant level.The purpose of this study was to explore the mechanism of ABA-induced freezing tolerance increase in grapevines. The specific objectives were to evaluate the impact of ABA treatment on soluble sugar concentration in grape buds and determine the correlations between freezing tolerance and ABA-affected soluble sugar concentration ...At maturity, grape showed the highest soluble sugar concentrations (16.5-26.3 g /100 g FW), followed by peach (2.2 to 20 g /100 g FW) and tomato (1.4 to 5 g /100 g FW). Main processes determining soluble sugar concentration were decomposed into sugar importation, metabolism and water dilution with the process-based analysis. Different ...Fruit species also showed a large diversity in soluble sugar concentration at maturity, with grape having the highest soluble sugar concentrations (16.5 to 26.3 g/100 g FW), followed by peach (2.2 to 20 g/100 g FW), cherry tomato (3.5 to 6.1 g/100 g FW), and tomato (1.4 to 5 g/100 g FW; Figure 1 ).The response of soluble sugar and starch concentrations to drought (>30 days of no water) were analysed separately as the ratio of the observed concentration in each organ after drought over the average concentration of each organ in the control.The concentration of soluble sugars of the sweet corn hybrids (186–261 g kg −1 DM, Fig. 2a) was in the range of the sweet sorghum varieties evaluated by Zhao et al. ( 2009 ), but lower than the concentration of commercial sugarcane or sugar beet varieties (Eggleston et al ., 2010 ).

Aboveground biomass (≈320GtC) represents ∼60% of global biomass, with belowground biomass composed mainly of plant roots (≈130GtC) and microbes residing in the soil and deep subsurface (≈100GtC), with ∼9GtC of terrestrial and marine bacteria and ∼12GtC in fungi.Group B had higher fresh biomass, total dry matter percentages, and dry biomass-related traits. The IGH KGS 99-100 and ISHs GU 07-3704, KGS 2004-13, KGS 2004-186, KGS 2004-60 and 99-489 can be ...Total biomass yields of 120 Mg ha −1 and up to 35 Mg dry matter (DM) ha −1 at the Ardoyne Farm and total biomass > 140 Mg ha −1 and 50 Mg DM ha −1 at Spanish Trail were observed. Sucrose levels ranging from 2000 to 8000 kg ha −1 were recorded between August and September of each year.This study demonstrated as the sugar beet biomass increased towards later growing period, biomass estimation using red light-based vegetation indices were less accurate as compared to that using band depth analysis in the vicinity of the red edge.

Specifically, in certain environments, the soil has the capacity to maintain the C content within a relatively stable range; when the soil C content is higher or lower than this range, the C content tends to return to this range.Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the largest carbon (C) stock in most terrestrial ecosystems (Lal, 2008a), containing approximately 2344 Gt of organic C globally (Stockmann et al., 2013). Moreover, soil is recognized as the second largest C pool after the oceans and one of the most important components of the biosphere, delivering major ecosystem ...This briefing presents the information on soil carbon that can be extracted from the 2021 national greenhouse gas inventories, as reported by EU Member States for the year 2019. It also gives an overview on the status of soil carbon pools across Europe.The organic C contents ranged from 9.3 to 120.6 g C kg −1, and forest soils had the highest SOC contents (50 ± 4 g kg −1 soil), followed by grasslands (38 ± 3 g kg −1 soil) and...Carbon saturation model. The C saturation model has a whole soil saturation limit ( C m ) (Fig. 2 b) due to inherent physicochemical limitations. In contrast to the linear model, the fundamental relationship between C addition levels and soil C levels at steady-state is asymptotic.Soil C content can be determined by the coefficients of humus and organic matter entering soil, while N is derived from the biological nitrogen fixation or entering soil through precipitation, and the main sources of P are leaching and rock weathering (Ding et al., 2012).Carbon (C) input is a prerequisite for the formation of soil organic matter and thus for soil organic C (SOC) sequestration. Here we used the C-TOOL model to simulate SOC changes in a long-term ...Soil organic carbon tends to be concentrated in the topsoil. Topsoil ranges from 0.5% to 3.0% organic carbon for most upland soils. Soils with less than 0.5% organic C are mostly limited to desert areas. Soils containing greater than 12–18% organic carbon are generally classified as organic soils.Soil carbonates (inorganic C mainly as CaCO) account for about 750 Gt C in the top 1 m and more than 2300 Gt in the top 2 m (nearly equal to organic C stocks). These inorganic C stocks have millennial to million-year turnover times and protect natural soils from degradation.The stock of C in the mineral soil was calculated for each depth (Cstock 0-10, Cstock 10-20, Cstock 20-30 and Cstock 30-40) following the next formula: \({Cstock}_{i}=TOCi*bDi*EFi*Ti\) being i: soil depth (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm or 30–40 cm), TOC: total organic carbon content (%), bD: bulk density (g cm −3), EF: earth ...

The obtained results showed that plant height was highest ...Next, as corrective fertilization, an application rate of 183 kg ha −1 of P was applied in the form of monobasic calcium phosphate (11.6% of P), according to Sousa and Lobato . Soil chemical parameters before and after acidity correction and P correction fertilization are presented in Table 4.

Nitrogen (N) fertilizer-induced soil acidification in Chinese croplands is well-known, but insight in the impacts of different N fertilizer management approaches (fertilizer type and rate) on soil acidification rates is very limited.Nitrogen application rates of < 150 kg ha –1 or 150–225 kg ha –1 were most effective under the three nitrogen application depths (Fig. 11), thereby indicating that low or medium nitrogen application rates could meet the crop growth requirements under deep nitrogen application, which is consistent with previous studies (Cheng et ...The N application rate between 1961 and 2020 for rice, vegetables and fruits showed the highest growth rate, increasing by 237.6%, 175.6%, and 252.3%, respectively, compared to wheat (152.2%...Nitrogen fertilization can increase soil organic C and N by increasing crop biomass yield, and the amount of residue returned to the soil . Russell et al. , however, reported no difference in soil organic C with N fertilization rate.To benefit banana agronomy and environment, the N application rate of 352 g N per plant could be suggested as the optimal N application rate in this region. Conclusion We demonstrated that different N application rates had great impacts on soil properties and banana leaf physiological attributes.A 2-year field experiment was conducted on the North China Plain to assess the effects of two straw management practices and different nitrogen fertilizer addition levels on soil organic matter (SOM) fractions and microbial properties under a winter wheat-summer maize cropping system.The field experiment consisted of five different split nitrogen fertilizer applications at an application rate of 240 kg⋅ha –1 (basal/dressing, 100/0%, 70/30%, 50/50%, 30/70%, 0/100%; hereafter referred to as N1, N2, N3, N4, and N5, respectively) with a randomized plot design ( Table 1 ).Our work demonstrates that the 100-seed-weight of B1N1 (biochar application rate at 3 kg·m−2, nitrogen application rate at 75 kg·ha−1) increased by 6.55% compared with that of the control. Meanwhile, we have confirmed that the leaf nitrogen contents can accurately predict the changes in NO3−-N in soil at a depth of 10–20 cm ...The highest mean SR value (1.75 mg CO 2 g −1 soil) was found under the highest N application rate (180 kg N ha −1) followed by the 90 kg N ha −1 rate, and these values were significantly higher than the 45 kg N ha −1 and 0 kg N ha −1 application rates .The results showed that, through the irrigation of 93 to 102, 92 to 98 and 92 to 98 mm, along with nitrogen applications of 65 to 71, 64 to 73 and 72 to 81 kg/hm2 at 17, 59 and 87 days after ...

Under sufficient N and K fertilization, P may modestly increase yield by 10–20% across crops and soils. Accordingly, such minimal effect could be justification for using half of the recommended P application rate (Valkama et al. 2009) under sufficient N and K conditions.The relative availability of soil P is highest at soil pH levels of 5 to 7 33,34, which would imply that around this pH fertiliser P application would yield the strongest responses.The objective of this study was to determine the suitable range of available phosphorus (P) and fertilizer application rate in a sugarcane-growing region with red soil in southern China. Thirty-five monitoring sites were selected to investigate the soil available P in relation to crop yield, P-use efficiency (PUE) and soil total P ...The farmyard manure (FYM, mainly comes from cow excretion) was applied with 75 t ha −1 year −1 on a dry basis, where the P content in the FYM was 2.4 g kg −1 per year from the application rate (equivalent to 180 kg P ha −1). All fertilizers were subsequently mixed and applied as a basal dose 5–7 days before sowing (Guo et ...This analysis addresses the effects of fertilizer-P placement on soil P reactions, P uptake, growth, yield, and yield components for the four crops.

We characterized the profiles of 35 sorghum accessions and identified 21 accessions with significantly different sugar concentrations between internodes either due to dried-up internodes or concentration differences.A new high-throughput methodology was developed for screening large variable populations of S. bicolor for biomass, soluble sugar concentrations, and cell wall composition using a volumetric correlation between the fourth internode from the base of the stalk that had expanded more than 2 cm, to that of the whole stalk (Figure 1).As the production of soluble sugar by sweet sorghum depends on extractable juice quantity and sweetness (Burks et al. 2015), further insight must be provided to the way stay-green ability influences sugar partitioning in internodes along the stem depending on plant water status.Della and Rio showed similarities in internode sugar concentration dynamics in several aspects. First, the total sugar concentrations were markedly increased in both genotypes from anthesis to 38 DAF (from ~ 9 to ~ 18% in Della and from ~ 12 to ~ 19% in Rio; Fig. 2d). Second, the upper internodes (internode 2–8 for Rio and ...The commonly used sugar measurement, Brix, limits the characterization of internode variation of the sugar concentrations due to its low throughput. Here we developed a low-cost, high-throughput ...

Leaf area index (LAI) is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes plant canopies. It is defined as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground surface area (LAI = leaf area / ground area, m 2 / m 2) in broadleaf canopies. In conifers, three definitions for LAI have been used: Half of the total needle surface area per unit ground ...Leaf Area Index. The Leaf Area Index is defined as half the total area of green elements of the canopy per unit horizontal ground area. The satellite-derived value corresponds to the total green LAI of all the canopy layers, including the understory which may represent a very significant contribution, particularly for forests. Practically, the ...L’indice foliaire, ou indice de surface foliaire (LAI, en anglais Leaf Area Index), est une grandeur sans dimension qui exprime la surface foliaire d’un arbre, d’un peuplement, d’un écosystème ou d’un biome par unité de surface de sol. Il est déterminé par l'estimation de la surface supérieure de l'intégralité des ...Leaf area index is defined as the projected area of leaves over a unit of land (m 2 m −2), so one unit of LAI is equivalent to 10,000 m 2 of leaf area per hectare. Sometimes LAI is expressed on the basis of all leaf surfaces. For broadleaf trees, the total is twice the projected area; for needle-leaf trees the conversion is between 2.4 and 2.6Leaf area index (LAI) quantifies the amount of leaf material in a canopy. By definition, it is the ratio of one-sided leaf area per unit ground area. LAI is unitless because it is a ratio of areas. For example, a canopy with an LAI of 1 has a 1:1 ratio of leaf area to ground area (Figure 1a). A canopy with an leaf area index of 3 would have a 3 ...Abstract. Leaf area index (LAI) is a critical vegetation structural variable and is essential in the feedback of vegetation to the climate system. The advancement of the global Earth Observation has enabled the development of global LAI products and boosted global Earth system modeling studies.The leaf area index (LAI) is the projected leaf area per unit of ground surface area (Watson , 1947). This is a dimensionless quantity and is the equivalent to m² of leaves per m² of soil (LAI = leaf area / ground area, m2 / m2). Leaf area index varies from 2 in some pine forests to 5-7 in closed stands, but it is not uncommon to measure ...Leaf area index (LAI) is the total one‐sided area of leaf tissue per unit ground surface area. It is a key parameter in ecophysiology, especially for scaling up the gas exchange from leaf to canopy level. It characterizes the canopy–atmosphere interface, where most of the energy fluxes exchange. It is also one of the most ...Leaf area index (LAI) is a critical vegetation structural variable and is essential in the feedback of vegetation to the climate system. The advancement of the global Earth Observation has enabled the development of global LAI products and boosted global Earth system modeling studies.

Leaves are generally composed of a few main parts: the blade and the petiole. Figure 13.1.2 13.1. 2: A leaf is usually composed of a blade and a petiole. The blade is most frequently the flat, photosynthetic part. The petiole is a stem that attaches the leaf blade to the main stem of the plant.Graph based method is proposed for leaf region segmentation. Circular Hough Transform is used to count the number of leaves in plant images. Abstract. This paper proposes an efficient method to extract the leaf region and count the number of leaves in digital plant images.Each leaf typically has a leaf blade ( lamina ), stipules, a midrib, and a margin. Some leaves have a petiole, which attaches the leaf to the stem; leaves that do not have petioles are directly attached to the plant stem and are called sessile leaves.In most plants, stems are located above the soil surface, but some plants have underground stems. Stems have several main functions: Support for and the elevation of leaves, flowers, and fruits. The stems keep the leaves in the light and provide a place for the plant to keep its flowers and fruits.These leaf meristems coordinate the orientation of the cell division plate, produce the main compartments of the leaf (the leaf blade and leaf petiole), and determine the proximal-distal gradient where the switch from cell proliferation to cell differentiation occurs in developing leaves (Donnelly et al., 1999; Ichihashi et al., 2011).A total of 1123 records for total leaf, total stem, and total plant size (M L, M S, and M T, respectively) and 548 records for plant height and DBH complied by Cannell (1982); Enquist and Niklas (2002), and Niklas and Enquist (2002a,b) were analyzed. The data included measurement taken on eudicot, monocot, and conifer species, and ...We identify this as a joint multi-leaf segmentation, alignment, and tracking problem. First, leaf segmentation and alignment are applied on the last frame of a plant video to ﬁnd a number of well-aligned leaf candidates. Second, leaf tracking is applied on the remaining frames with leaf candidate transformation from the previous frame.angiosperm. Table of Contents. Angiosperm - Stems, Photosynthesis, Reproduction: The stem conducts water and minerals from the roots and food from the site of synthesis to various parts. The angiosperm leaf consists of a leaf base, two stipules, a petiole, and a blade.A few mutants such as broad leaf 1 (blf1) and gigas (gig) produce large leaf blades that are up to twice the normal width. In contrast, the angustifolium-a (fol-a) and narrow leaf dwarf (nld) mutants have small, narrow leaf blades. The brachytic (brh) mutants often have relatively short leaf blades.Each image was labeled in two annotation levels. The first is the number of leaves, and the second is a leaf center dot annotation. The size of the images varies between 441 × 441 and 2, 448 × 2, 048, and they were resized to 800 × W where W was chosen to keep the original aspect ratio. To enrich the datasets, random transformations were ...

Open in figure viewer PowerPoint. Allocation in relation to total plant dry mass (TDM). (a–c) The fractional allocation to leaves (LMF), stems (SMF) and roots (RMF), respectively, for herbaceous species. (d–f) The fractional allocation to leaves, stems and roots, respectively, for woody species.There is convincing evidence for a scaling relationship between leaf dry weight ( DW) and leaf surface area ( A) for broad-leaved plants, and most estimates of the scaling exponent of DW vs. A are greater than unity. However, the scaling relationship of leaf fresh weight ( FW) vs. A has been largely neglected.Estimation of leaf dry biomass from the product of leaf dimensions. The correlations, linear regression and polynomial models between leaf dry biomass and the product of leaf dimensions are presented in Fig. 4. Most of the best models obtained were polynomial models with a logarithmic transformation of the data.Reduced major axis regression was used to fit the log-transformed data of leaf biomass and area, and the bootstrap percentile method was used to test the significance of the difference between...We compared abundance-weighted values of two of the most widely used traits from the leaf economics spectrum (specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content) with measured aNPP across a temperate ecosystem gradient. We found that leaf dry matter content (LDMC) as opposed to specific leaf area (SLA) was the superior predictor of aNPP ...Dry weight biomass measurements with electronic balance. Overview. Total dry mass is often used as an indication of plant fitness. In particular, dry vegetative mass is generally correlated to reproductive mass. In addition, the plant samples may be split into leaves, stems and roots. This enables calculation of the root to shoot ratio, and ...Two different equations were determined to estimate leaf area and dry biomass from leaf dimensions. The relation between leaf area (A) and the product of length (L) × width (Wi) was defined by the linear equation A = 0.60 × L × Wi whereas dry biomass (We) was predicted by a power law We = 0.004 × (L × Wi)1.11. This method could ...Leaf dry matter content (ratio of leaf dry mass to leaf saturated mass) is an index of mass investment in photosynthetic organs that is positively correlated with leaf density and negatively correlated with leaf [N] and plant growth (Garnier et al., 2004; Polley, Yang, et al., 2020a).The relationship between leaf area and plant biomass was found to be non-linear and variable depending on carbon partitioning. The model output was sensitive to the rate of photosynthesis but more sensitive to the amount of carbon partitioned to growing thicker leaves.Specific leaf area (SLA) was calculated as the leaf area per unit dry leaf mass. Measurement of biomass and productivity allocation to absorptive root and leaf We measured the diameter (at breast height) of 26–38 trees for two consecutive years at each site.

Allocation to leaves (a), stems (b) and roots (c) in various biomes of the world. For some biomes, there is a paucity of studies distinguishing between leaf, stem and root biomass. In these cases, we added additional observations for which vegetation was separated into above- and below-ground biomass, from which the root mass ...Reduced major axis regression was used to fit the log-transformed data of leaf biomass and area, and the bootstrap percentile method was used to test the significance of the difference between...The model showed that maximizing leaf area growth by small reductions in C partitioning to leaf thickening with subsequent increments to leaf area growth, during early stages of vegetative growth has profoundly positive effects on leaf area, leaf mass, and plant biomass as seen in gi-2.“Diminishing returns” in leaf economics occurs when increases in lamina mass (M), which can either be represented by lamina dry mass (DM) or fresh mass (FM), fail to produce proportional increases in leaf surface area (A), such that the scaling exponent (α) for the M vs. A scaling relationship exceeds unity (i.e., α > 1.0 ...The scaling relationship for leaf fresh mass vs. leaf area was statistically robust for each of the six species, and the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the α was greater than 1.0 for all six species (Fig. 4). Likewise, the R 2 exceeded 0.90 in all species.To test whether there are general patterns in biomass partitioning in relation to environmental variation when stand biomass is considered, we investigated biomass allocation in leaves, stems...Fresh leaf samples were killed using an oven at 105°C and dried at 65°C to a constant weight, then weighed for dry weight and the biomass of the needle leaves was calculated. 2.3. Determination of biomass of leaf per plantLeaf dry mass per unit area (LMA) is considered to represent the photosynthetic capacity, which actually implies a hypothesis that foliar water mass (leaf fresh weight minus leaf dry weight) is proportional to leaf dry weight during leaf growth.The truncation treatment described here represents a promising rejuvenation technique for increasing leaf size, fresh weight (FW), photosynthetic capacity, and leaf biomass and delaying senescence in G. biloba. In addition, increasing the production of bioactive flavonoids in medicinal plant species is desirable. We found that the ...This paper describes a simple technique for the fermentation of untreated or partly-treated leafy biomass in a digester of novel design without incurring the normal problems of feeding, floating and scum formation of feed, etc.

Here, we investigated the sugar content, gene expression, and the activity of sucrose-metabolizing enzymes in the leaves of Hevea brasiliensis, a tropical tree widely cultivated for natural rubber. Sucrose, fructose and glucose were the major sugars detected in Hevea leaves at four developmental stages (I to IV), with starch and ...Soluble sugar and starch concentrations in the leaves increased or decreased immediately after the temperature was reduced or raised. A strong gradient of changes was observed for up to 36 h and 60 h in soluble sugars and starch, respectively.Soluble sugars trigger the proliferation of organs and produce larger and thicker leaves, increases the size and number of tubers and adventitious roots (Gibson, 2005). It has been reported when sucrose is present in higher concentration in potatoes leads to increase the number of tubers (Gibson, 2005).We measured the concentration of starch, soluble sugar, NSC, and the soluble sugar:starch ratio in leaves, twigs, trunks and roots of twenty dominant species for dry and wet season in monsoon ...Similar elevations in soluble sugar concentrations of leaves in response to flooding were observed in Acosmium nitens (Vog.) Benth., Eschweilera tenuifolia, Campsiandra laurifolia, and Symmeria paniculata Benth., accompanied in all cases by elevated leaf starch concentrations (Rengifo et al. 2005). In contrast to the rather substantial effects of flooding observed, seedling responses to short ...Increased concentration of soluble sugars triggered the propagation of organs and produced larger and thicker leaves (Gibson, 2005). High sugar accumulation caused increase in the size and number of tubers in potatoes, enhanced adventitious roots formation in Arabidopsis , and also promoted cell division and cell expansion and ...Sensing intracellular soluble sugar pathways, however, provides incomplete information about the metabolic status of plant cells, since they ignore the concentration of soluble sugars in the apoplast and, perhaps more importantly, the apoplast-cytosol and the vacuole-cytosol fluxes of sugars. Consequently, a complex signalling network underlying to sugar-sensing pathways is present.Soluble sugars (mono- and disaccharides) play a main role in the assembly and functioning of all living cells. Their origin gives the impression to be firmly connected with prebiotic and primary biotic evolution (Hazra et al. 2019 ).The soluble sugar/starch ratio of C. lanceolate decreased with increasing shading degree, whereas that of S. superb remained stable. Leaf C:N ratio decreased while N:P ratio increased with increasing shading degree; leaf C:P ratio was highest in 60% shading degree for C. lanceolata and in 40% shading degree for S. superba. S. superba ...From many aspects including plants’ perception of water stress signal, signal conversion and transmission, induced gene expression, the changes in soluble sugar and the enzyme activities of organic acids, as well as the final sugar and acid content in fruits, this thesis summarized previous studies on the influence of water stress ...

Such ratios have been calculated from inventory sources for many broadleaf forest types (young secondary to mature) growing in ...The root/shoot ratio (RSR) is the ratio of the belowground biomass to the aboveground biomass, which is the parameter that most directly reflects biomass allocation by plants. Many plants would change their RSR in response to shading or low nutrient availability ( Reynolds and D'antonio, 1996 ; Aphalo et al., 1999 ), so RSR is an ...The sub-sample dry and fresh weights were used to determine the tree specific dry to fresh weights ratios (DF-ratios) which were used to convert measured fresh tree mass in the field to dry weight biomass [Citation 27]. The average wood density (g cm −3) per sample tree was calculated as oven-dry divided by volume at saturation point ...Above- and belowground biomass allocation. There were significant differences in the SMF, RMF and R/S among the six species ( P < 0.001, Fig. 3 ). The average RMF was the highest in M. sativa (46.5%), followed by L. chinensis (38.2%), S. grandis (36.3%), C. squarrosa (24.0%), S. viridis (3.7%) and C. glaucum (3.6%).where y is the crop’s yield (Mg ha −1), ω is the dry matter fraction of its harvested biomass, h is its harvest index (fraction of total AGB collected at harvest) and c is the carbon content ...Article Open access Published: 09 May 2022 An allometric model-based approach for estimating biomass in seven Indian bamboo species in western Himalayan foothills, India R. Kaushal, S. Islam,...Above-ground dry biomass of these six crops was more accurately estimated from the assimilation of LAI derived from both satellites (R 2 (the coefficient of determination) = 0.81, RMSE (the root-mean-square-error) = 135.4 g/m 2, nRMSE (the normalized RMSE) = 37.9%, RPD (the ratio of percent deviation) = 2.26) than that of LAI derived ...The effects of grazing on plant biomass and diversity depended on climate types and grazing patterns. Specifically, grazing significantly decreased plant total biomass and belowground biomass in dry areas only, but increased rootshoot ratio in wet areas only. Growing season and year-long grazing decreased total biomass, whereas non-growing ...

Soil C content can be determined by the coefficients of humus and organic matter entering soil, while N is derived from the biological nitrogen fixation or entering soil through precipitation, and the main sources of P are leaching and rock weathering (Ding et al., 2012).In this study, we analyzed the seasonal dynamics of soil net ammonification, net nitrification, net mineralization rates and soil inorganic N content and their responses to N addition in the third growing season (May to September) after N addition. The main purposes were to reveal the effects of atmospheric N deposition on N ...Soil C, N contents and C:N stoichiometry are important indicators of soil quality, the variation characteristics of which have great significance for soil carbon-nitrogen cycle and sustainable utilization. Based on 597 observations along with soil profiles of 0–20cm depth in the 1980s and the 2010s, the temporal and spatial variations of soil C, N contents and C:N stoichiometry in the major ...The soil is classified as a Cambic soil (43% sand, 36% silt, 21% clay, 5.2% organic matter) with a pH of 6.2. Historically, this area has been subject to a mid-intensive grassland management scheme (early season mowing with medium inputs of organic fertilizer, late seasonal grazing).Abstract. This study evaluated the effect of a dairy system involving grazing over the winter on a soil surface N balance (SSB) and soluble N content in a clay loam soil in comparison with early spring calving systems. The SSBs were calculated for each paddock within three dairy systems for 2 years.Soil water content affects the moisture and amount of nutrients available to plants and soil aeration status. Soil water content can be measured on a mass or volume basis. Gravimetric soil water content is the mass of water in the soil, measured as the difference between the moist soil and the soil dried at 105°C, known as the oven-dry weight ...Vocabulary. Soil contains air, water, and minerals as well as plant and animal matter, both living and dead. These soil components fall into two categories. In the first category are biotic factors—all the living and once-living things in soil, such as plants and insects.It was found that soil organic matter (SOM) and silt content were the main factors to determine cation exchange capacity and specific surface area. Both cation exchange capacity and specific surface area were closely related to silt content but weakly related to clay content, possibly due to the high silt content in our studied soils ...Each land use category includes two soil categories — mineral soil and organic soil. Organic soil has a high carbon content (see box 1). Soils in the 2019 LULUCF sector inventories. The EU LULUCF sector is a significant sink, meaning that it removes CO 2 from the atmosphere by storing more carbon on land. However, there are large differences in carbon storage capacity between countries ...The total N contents varied from 2.0 to 3.7 g kg −1 soil and followed a similar pattern to that of the SOC contents, except for (sub)tropical soils corresponding to particles < 63 µm (Fig. 2D ...

This suggests that high soluble sugar concentration in the stem of TS is due to a factor other than the small panicle caused by the sp1 mutation. Therefore, in the present study, we characterized sugar metabolism in the stem of TS to obtain clues to the cause of its high sugar concentration.Soluble sugar and starch concentrations of developing grains of panicle on main shoot were measured between days 7 and 19 post-anthesis (Figs. 3, 4). www.nature.com/scientificreports...Soluble sugar and starch concentrations of developing grains of panicle on main shoot were measured between days 7 and 19 post-anthesis (Figs. 3, 4).33 Citations Metrics Abstract The yield-increasing mechanism of an optimized nitrogen fertilizer application (OFA) in rice was reported in this work through a three-year test. Results showed that...To observe the structure of vascular bundles in the branches in different positions of the panicle, one-fifth of the branches sampled were fixed in FAA solution (38% formaldehyde: glacial acetic acid: 70% alcohol = 1:1:18), and then stored at 4°C for optical microscopy (OM) observation.However, the soluble sucrose content was 61% higher in the panicle of Milyang360 than in that of Saeilmi (Fig. 1c). However, there was no difference in photosynthesis rate between the two ...Soluble sugars and sucrose were higher through the entire period from panicle initiation to maturity under LN than under HN (Figures 3C,D). The NSC and starch concentrations in SY63 were higher than in LYPJ from panicle initiation to heading and lower after heading under both the LN and HN treatments. From 6 to 24 days after heading ...Kono (Citation 2011) reported that soluble sugar concentration in the stem of Kusanohoshi was increased by panicle-thinning treatment, but that the elevated concentration was still lower than the concentration in the stem of Tachisuzuka. These insights suggest that the influence of panicle size reduction on stem soluble sugar reserves is ...Total sugar soluble content and proline content of rice cv. Leum Pua inoculated with or without AMFs (Funneliformis mosseae; F, with Claroideoglomus etunicatum; C, and Acaulospora fovaeta; A, in F ...In addition to the low grain/straw ratio conferred by the small panicle trait, the two WCS cultivars accumulate a high concentration of soluble sugars in their stems, which is an outstanding feature contributing to better fermentation quality of the silage (Matsushita et al., 2011, 2014).

This theory, narrowed down to sugar nutrients, states that a minimal level of sugar assimilates needs to reach the apex (flowering) or lateral bud (removal of apical dominance) before floral transition or lateral bud outgrowth is initiated.A greater rate of phloem unloading and storage in the stem, not a higher rate of sugar production by photosynthesis or sugar export from leaves, is the mai Physiology and whole-plant carbon partitioning during stem sugar accumulation in sweet dwarf sorghum | SpringerLinkThis paper shows data of sugarcane stem height on plots selected by reflectance sensor during two growing seasons compared to biomass accumulation and N-uptake on commercial sugarcane fields ...The present study examined whether the apparent association between sugar accumulation in the stem and plant height is the result of selection, or dictated by physiological or genetic constraints. The data from the complementary experiments reported in this study indicate that sorghums do not have to be tall in order to accumulate ...On these experimental shoots (>150 cm long), all buds were removed leaving only the apical 10 cm of the shoot intact with 3–4 buds. On each tree, three branches were girdled at 10, 20 or 40 cm from the apex and one branch was left as a control (non-girdled). Girdling was done using a dull razor blade to avoid cutting into xylem. A ...The infusion point (position) was at the stem height of 80-100 cm . One week later (on July 7, 2021), we used a 1 mL-syringe to inject 0.8 mL 13 C-labelled glucose solution into the lower segment of each 70 cm-long rubber tube, and the hole on the tube was immediately sealed with an adhesive layer.First results in imaging the 3D shape of sugar beet have been used to extract scalar parameters of the tap root such as height, width, volume and surface area. By imaging over time the development and growth can be observed.The APEX data were recorded on 1 July 2015 in Belgium (flying height 3900 m) and on 20 March 2015 in Luxembourg (flying height 4700 m). The location of the two study areas is shown in Figure 1.Three 20 m × 20 m plots were randomly established in each forests. Forest stand density, stem diameter at breast height (DBH), plant height (H) and soil nutrient content were measured for woody species within each plot. Sample information shown in Table 1.To identify the constraints on stem sugar accumulation in sweet sorghum, we used a combination of carbon-11 (11 C) radiotracer, physiological and biochemical approaches, and compared a grain sorghum and sweet dwarf sorghum line that have similar growth characteristics including height. Photosynthesis did not increase during ...

Because wells are not always drilled vertically, there may be two "depths" for every given point in a wellbore: the measured depth (MD) measured along the path of the borehole, and the true vertical depth (TVD), the vertical distance between the datum and the point of interest.1. n. [Drilling] The vertical distance from a point in the well (usually the current or final depth) to a point at the surface, usually the elevation of the rotary kelly bushing (RKB). This is one of two primary depth measurements used by the drillers, the other being measured depth.Typically, the maximum inclination is reduced to zero at Dt with drop radius R1, derived in the same manner as the build radius, R.

schemes ensures reduced smearing without impairing convergence property. TVD schemes develop formulae for interpolation of a cell-face value of the transported variable. If the interpolated value is bounded by the neighbouring nodal values then the scheme is ‘Bounded’. However, not all TVD schemes possess this property of ‘Boundedness’. Thethis paper we propose some natural limitations on the interpolated values between two mesh points and we establish in the third part su cient conditions that prove that the resulting scheme is TVD.A TVD scheme with alternating compressive and diffusive limiters (TVDal) is proposed for modeling the advection process. • Numerical errors can be reduced by approximately 60% based on benchmark tests using TVDal. • TVDal combining with splitting methods is used to model multiple dimensional advection.In this study, a one-dimensional TVD scheme was applied to the unstructured mesh.

Johansen et al. researched the predictability of fresh shoot mass (SM), number of fruits (FN), and yield mass at harvest using UAV-based imagery and indicated that plant area, border length, width, and length of plant had the highest importance in the random forest approach to modeling of biomass and yield.Box-and-whisker plots, showing the variation in red–green–blue (RGB) and multispectral unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) predicted fresh shoot mass, fruit numbers, and yield mass throughout the growing season in relation to field-based observations at the time of harvest.the predictability of fresh shoot mass (SM), number of fruits (FN), and yield mass at harvest using UAV-based imagery and indicated that plant area, border length, width, and length of plant had the highest importance in the random forest approach to modeling of biomass and yield. Candiago et al. [13] examined the vegetation vigorIn total, three LMR models and three RF models were developed for estimating larch forest biomass at the plot level, each of which was then evaluated using test data not seen in model calibration (Table 3).Using linear regression models under a censored-normal distribution, we determined the Fruit Count and Stem Density methods could accurately estimate fruit biomass; however, when comparing AIC values between models, the Fruit Count method was the superior method for estimating fruit biomass.1.1.1. Definitions Plant biomass (W) is the weight of living plant material contained above and below a unit of ground surface area at a given point in time. Production is the biomass or weight of organic matter assimilated by a community or species per unit land area per unit time.The prediction tests of these models indicated that the errors were large when predicting the fruit number and the seed biomass of smaller trees (DBH ≤ 20 cm) and bigger trees (DBH ≥ 30 cm). For medium-size trees (20 cm < DBH < 30 cm), the error was small.| Scatterplots showing the linear relationships between field-measured and predicted (A) fresh shoot mass, (B) fruit numbers, and (C) yield mass based on the multispectral unmanned aerial vehicle ...Second, examine the accuracy of predictions of tomato fresh shoot masses (SM), fruit weights (FW), and the number of fruits (FN) from multiple machine learning algorithms using selected variable sets.Being the tenth largest tropical fruit producer, Bangladesh is the second in jackfruit and seventh in mango production among the world's fruit-producing countries.

Global yield datasets for the historical past have increasingly been used to analyze climate-crop ...Crop Harvest Area: 1000 ha (10 7 m 2) per 5-arcminute grid cell. Crop Production: 1000 tonnes (10 6 kg) per 5-arcminute grid cell. Crop Yield: tonnes per ha (10 −1 kg m −2) per 5-arcminute ...Studies across different crops demonstrated that grain or seed number per unit area (GN m –2) is the dominant yield component. Although grains or seeds derive from floret or flower production and survival, the timing of the critical period for GN m –2 determination is known to vary noticeably, from mainly pre-flowering to ...Crop yields are the harvested production per unit of harvested area for crop products. In most of the cases yield data are not recorded, but are obtained by dividing the production data by the data on area harvested.How much cropland has the world spared due to increases in crop yields? Almond yields; Area of land needed to meet global vegetable oil demand; Area of land needed to produce one tonne of vegetable oil; Banana yields; Barley yields; Bean yields; Cashew nut yields; Cassava yields; Cereal yield vs. GDP per capita; Cereal yield vs. extreme poverty ...The EU produced 270.9 million tonnes of cereals in 2022, 26.7 million tonnes less than in 2021. The harvested production of many crops was impacted by drought conditions in large parts of the EU, including grain maize (down 27.4%), sunflowers (down 10.1%), and olives for olive oil (down 38.1%).The determination of grain yield requires knowledge of the harvest area, the weight of the ears or the weight of the total kernels per plot, the moisture content, and the appropriate percentage of yield adjustment depending on moisture content in the given environment.grain yield. Consistently, the objectives of this study were to identify the soil attributes that a˙ect grain yield and generate a model to recommend sowing rates as a function of these attributes.To standardize crop yields across studies, we focused the analysis on relative yields, defined as the ratio of crop yield in the intercropped system to crop yield in the sole crop treatment (Yu et al., 2015).All of the selected studies had information on crop yield at a control site from which we calculated relative yields in the AF stand; the only exception was Moreno et al. (2007) who ...

The results indicated that the whole grain yield of Japanese barnyard millet cultivar PRJ-1 was significantly higher than Indian Barnyard millet cultivars VL 172 and VL 207; however, the dehulled grain recovery was considerably higher in VL 172 and VL 207 than PRJ-1.Varietal differences: The dehulled yield of 1,000 spelt lines varied from 55–75% of hulled weight (Stallknecht et al., 1996a). Emmer and einkorn potentially add greater variability when compared to spelt. Grain moisture. Equipment: Because of variations in equipment, yield will depend on the equipment setting, speed, and operator skill.The yield of dehulled grain after at least 90% of the hull had been removed, ranged from 74-89%. Dehulling efficiency, a measure of the amount of hull in the abraded material, ranged from...In this study, an innovative technology was developed for applying cold plasma-assisted buckwheat grain dehulling. The mechanism of dehulling and the farinographical properties of dehulled buckwheat flour were analyzed. Furthermore, we also compared the effects of cold plasma treatment and traditional heat treatment on the quality ...SEM images of the millets shows the impact of dehulling on the surface morphology of the grains (little, barnyard, proso, and kodo millets). This calls for research and development of novel food processing technologies to minimize loss and damage during processing of climate resilient crops.Yield of dehulled grain was 80%, with most of the hulls removed in the form of fines. The reduction in fat content of the dehulled grain was not as great as in the case of the Senegal sorghum. Sieve analysis showed that 98.1% of the grain did not pass the 8 mesh sieve. After dehulling 54.5% did not pass, indicating 45.5% breakage.The process of dehulling buckwheat grain should lead to less breaking of the buckwheat grain and improve the whole kernel recovery rate. However, heat treatment-based delhulling is associated with starch gelatinization, protein denaturation, and degradation of flavonoids.The major determinants of dehulling yield obtained through centrifugal system are moisture content of the grain, the peripheral speed of the impeller, and the feed rate (Gupta and Das 1999). Soaking is another cheap method of dehulling utilized in millets.9240 Switzerland Contact us To maximize the process output of oilseed, grain and pulses, you need to separate hulls from their kernels efficiently. Bühler offers a wide range of dehulling and hull separation processes which you can tailor to your product.The highest yield of 73.7 % was achieved at about 972 J/g with a little change in colour (CIELAB ΔE* value of 2.58). The corresponding dehulling time, cooking time and losses during dehulling were respectively 185 s, 10 min and 15.1 % as compared to 492 s, 20 min and 31.5 % for control respectively.

In this study, we aimed to explore which regression models and phenotypic traits derived from lidar data are best for estimating maize biomass (not biomass density) at four levels, including plot, individual plant, leaf group, and individual organ (i.e., individual leaf or stem) levels.Thus, we had estimates of foliar biomass on one-to-three branches in 6–10 annual shoots per tree, and specific leaf area (m 2 /kg) on one of those branches. 2.3. Model development. We developed equations to predict foliar biomass and specific leaf area at three scales: branch, annual shoot, and whole-crown.In total, three LMR models and three RF models were developed for estimating larch forest biomass at the plot level, each of which was then evaluated using test data not seen in model calibration (Table 3).We modelled foliage biomass and SLA at three scales of organization: individual primary branches, annual shoots (all branches on an annual increment of the main stem), and the whole tree. We used a variety of independent variables that range in scale from the branch to plot level.Plot-level biomass estimates were combined with Landsat imagery and geomorphometric and climate layers to map aboveground tree biomass. We compared biomass estimates for individual trees, plots, and at the landscape-scale using our locally-developed allometric equations, nationwide equations applied across the U.S., and the Forest ...In estimating the forest biomass carbon and its response under climate change, the issue of scaling has resulted in difficulties when modelling the biomass for different-sized trees, especially...The relation between leaf area ( A) and the product of length ( L ) × width (Wi) was defined by the linear equation A = 0.60 × L × Wi whereas dry biomass (We) was predicted by a power law We = 0.004 × ( L × Wi) 1.11. This method could also be tested and applied to other species. IntroductionBiomass estimation is one of the crucial tasks of forest ecology.

Biomass at the plot level was indirectly measured by converting fresh weight to dry weight according to established relationships built from randomly selected samples . Specifically, all individual maize plants within each plot were first harvested and weighted fresh in the field using an electronic scale with an accuracy of 1 g ...For each plot in the study area, five squares of an area of 0.25 m 2 were randomly established (25 quadrats in total), where the herbaceous vegetation was cut at ground level. ...In general, foliage biomass is concentrated vertically in the central parts of the crown, increasing downward from the top of the tree to some maximum and then decreasing to the base of the crown ( Kantola and Mäkelä, 2004, Schneider et al., 2011 ).The mean foliar biomass of individual branches (FB B) was 25% greater in spruce than pine (Table 3) despite the similarity in size of trees of both species, i.e., similar mean and range of branch diameters (D BR), total tree heights (H T), diameters at breast height (D BH), and crown lengths (CL B).Plot-level traits: scaling leaf-level to plot-level measurements. Each plot had a planted species richness of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16, with an average of 6 species per plot. Complete sampling of all species would require 54 spectral measurements to estimate plot-level traits for a single plot (54 = 6 species ∗ 3 individuals ∗ 3 canopy ...The results showed that waveform metrics have strong potential for estimating woody (R 2 = 0.71) and foliar biomass (R 2 = 0.73) at the tree-level in a savanna environment [37]. ... ...The variance of the plot-level biomass is the sum of the within- and between-strata variance: Var (M) = ∑ i = 1 p π i Var (M i) + S p 2 where Var (M i) is the plot-level biomass variance within stratum i as defined in Section 2.2, and S p 2 is the between-strata variance of biomass: S p 2 = | A | 2 ∑ i = 1 p π i [λ i E (B i ...1.1.1. Definitions. Plant biomass (W) is the weight of living plant material contained above and below a unit of ground surface area at a given point in time. Production is the biomass or weight of organic matter assimilated by a community or species per unit land area per unit time.Comparisons between the measured and predicted fresh biomass (FM) at the plot level (N = 386) in the combined dataset from six prediction models: (A) M1: FM ∼ NDVI + Sonar _ PH + NDVI × Sonar _ PH, (B) M2: FM ∼ NDVI + LV _ PH + NDVI × LV _ PH, (C) M3: F M ~ L V × N D V I, (D) M4: F M ~ L V × L V _ D e n, (E) M5: F M ~ L V × ...Our results demonstrate that: (1) tree height and NM may independently control foliar structure and physiology, and have an even greater impact on biomass allocation; and (2) the modified within‐plant light availabilities alone do not explain the observed patterns.

Leaf dry matter content: Leaf dry-matter content (LDMC) is the oven-dry mass (mg) of a leaf, divided by its water-saturated fresh mass (g), expressed in mg g-1 Using these units, LWC is simply 1000-LDMC. LDMC is related to the average density (fresh mass per fresh volume) of the leaf tissues.Summary. •. This study compared the predictive ability of dry matter content (DMC, dry mass per fresh mass) of leaves, stems, roots and entire plants in relation to dry matter concentration (D, dry mass per volume of plant organ). Data came from 28 species of field-collected plants (woody and herbaceous) and 17 species of ...Leaf-colour modification is expected to improve dry matter accumulation either by extending the canopy duration (G traits) (Gregersen et al., 2013, Borrell et al., 2014) or by allowing more light penetrated into the lower canopy (Y traits) (Ort et al., 2011, Gu et al., 2017b).Linear regression relationships between measured leaf thickness (LT, μm) and the inverse of the product of specific leaf area (SLA, m 2 kg −1) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC, mg g −1) for all studies (open circles) and for succulent-leaved species (filled circles with outliers, Crassula sp. and Euphorbia sp. indicated by ...Both for green leaves and litter, these traits represented (a) leaf structure, that is specific leaf area (SLA, fresh area per dry mass) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC, dry mass per saturated mass) and (b) leaf chemistry, including nitrogen concentration ([N]), phosphorus concentration ([P]), carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) and pH.PDF | This study compared the predictive ability of dry matter content (DMC, dry mass per fresh mass) of leaves, stems, roots and entire plants in... | Find, read and cite all the research you ...In vitro dry matter degradation For leaf blades, 1-cm sections of coastal bermuda grass were prepared for digestion studies in Hungate tubes as described (Akin and Rigsby, 1987 ). For stems, 1-cm sections of the fifth internode from the apex of bermuda grass plants were cut as described (Akin et al., 1989).Leaf dry matter content (LDMC) is widely used as an indicator of plant resource use in plant functional trait databases. Two main methods have been proposed to measure LDMC, which basically differ in the rehydration procedure to which leaves are subjected after harvesting.In order to convert the data to dry matter weight per square meter, the original data were multiplied by the expected number of plants per square meter under the four different treatments. The aboveground dry matter includes that of the leaf blades, leaf sheaths, stems, and ears.Leaves were considered as dead, when the leaf blade was either completely yellow or by at least 50% dry and dead. Leaf area of all green leaves was measured with a LI-COR leaf area meter (LI-3000C) in combination with a belt conveyer accessory (LI-3050C). All plant material was dried at 70 °C for at least 48 h and weighed.

Leaves are generally composed of a few main parts: the blade and the petiole. Figure 13.1.2 13.1. 2: A leaf is usually composed of a blade and a petiole. The blade is most frequently the flat, photosynthetic part. The petiole is a stem that attaches the leaf blade to the main stem of the plant.The flat structure of a leaf blade enables it to function as a photosynthetic organ for efficient light capture. The leaf rim or the edge-most region of leaf margin directs the planar...The second experiment, which investigated fresh and air-dried leaf-blades of 4.0 and 0.5 cm cut-lengths, fermentation of fresh leaf-blades produced results similar to those obtained in the first experiment. The 4.0 cm cut-lengths, relative to the 0.5 cm cut lengths, produced more (17.9%) gas and more (26.9%) fermentation end-products ...Each leaf typically has a leaf blade called the lamina, which is also the widest part of the leaf. Some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a petiole. Leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called sessile leaves. Leaves also have stipules, small green appendages usually found at the base of the ...Green leaves are fundamental for the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems (Wright et al., 2004) because green leaf blades are the principal organs of net primary productivity, gas exchange, and evapotranspiration.Leaf damage during and after harvest is affected by crop species. • Small round lesions appear on leaf blade and edges. • Post-harvest processing modifies leaf microbial community structure. • Highly damaged leaves should be removed before packaging.(C): Differences in leaf blade margin of fresh leaf cross sections of A donax leaves: (a) green mature leaf, (b) senescent leaf.

The latter...Total dry matter mass (TDM), potentially digestible dry matter (pDDM), dry pseudostem (DP), green pseudostem (GP), dry leaf blade (DLB) and green leaf blade (GLB) of Marandu...Leaf dry matter content: Leaf dry-matter content (LDMC) is the oven-dry mass (mg) of a leaf, divided by its water-saturated fresh mass (g), expressed in mg g-1 Using these units, LWC is simply 1000-LDMC. LDMC is related to the average density (fresh mass per fresh volume) of the leaf tissues.Leaf dry mass. Leaves (including blade, petiole, and stipules when present) were then dried for a minimum of 72 hours at 65 °C before dry mass was measured to the nearest 0.0001 g. 5.Leaf dry mass multiplied by the specific leaf area is converted into leaf area. Direct methods in evergreen species are necessarily destructive. However, they are widely used in crops and pastures by harvesting the vegetation and measuring leaf area within a certain ground surface area.Leaf mass per area (LMA) is a morphological trait widely used as a good indicator of plant functioning (i.e. photosynthetic and respiratory rates, chemical composition, resistance to herbivory, etc.).Summary. •. This study compared the predictive ability of dry matter content (DMC, dry mass per fresh mass) of leaves, stems, roots and entire plants in relation to dry matter concentration (D, dry mass per volume of plant organ). Data came from 28 species of field-collected plants (woody and herbaceous) and 17 species of ...Depending on the size of the individual leaves, LT was measured on five to ten points per leaf (blade), avoiding the mid-vein. Leaves were then oven-dried at 60 °C for at least 2 d, and their dry mass was determined. From these measurements, mean values of LDMC, SLA and LT were calculated.

However, independently from moisture content, maize straw can be a good (for more wet material) or very good (for more dried straw) substrate for the biogas plant.Statement of Novelty. Cereal straw is an abundant agricultural by-product in Europe. This study provides new knowledge on straw availability and the potential impact of large-scale straw removal on organic matter in agricultural soils in a regional investigation in Sweden.5.2 Crop production. The interaction of straw biochar and fertilizer is advocated as a good approach for improving soil qualities, thereby increasing crop biomass accumulation and crop productivity. In addition, the application of straw biochar alone may not increase crop productivity and may reduce crop yields.Straw Biomass. It is evident that straw biomass is an abundant and inexpensive lignocellulosic resource for manufacturing eco-building materials.

CHLOROPHYLLE-MèTRE SPAD 502 PLUS à pince. Les pinces à chlorophylle SPAD 502 Plus quantifient la santé de vos cultures. Mesure instantanément la teneur en chlorophylle des feuilles de plantes sur une échelle de 0,0 à 99,9; Mesures non invasives et non destructives Un graphique des tendances stocke et affiche jusqu’à 30 mesuresThe SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter (Konica Minolta Sensing, Inc., Osaka, Japan) calculates the SPAD value based on the intensity of light transmitted around 650 nm (red band) where absorption by chlorophyll is high and a reference wavelength around 940 nm [31].Since the chlorophyll content and the soil–plant analysis development (SPAD) value are positively correlated, it is feasible to predict the SPAD value by calculating the vegetation indices (VIs) through hyperspectral images, thereby evaluating the severity of plant diseases. However, current indices simply adopt few wavelengths of ...SPAD readings are calculated based on two transmission values: the transmission of red light at 650 nm, which is absorbed by chlorophyll and the transmission of infrared light at 940 nm, at...This research aimed to determine the formula to convert SPAD- 502 and atLEAF CHL PLUS values (relative indicator of chlorophyll content) to estimated (absolute) rubber leaves chlorophyll content. Twenty leaves of rubber plant were measured using SPAD- 502 and atLEAF CHL PLUS at the same time to determine SPAD-502 and atLEAF CHL PLUS values.The Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) chlorophyll meter is one of the most commonly used diagnostic tools to measure crop nitrogen status. However, the measurement method of the meter could significantly affect the accuracy of the final estimation.A SPAD-502 Plus chlorophyll meter was used to determine a chlorophyll content index (CCI). Leaves of different greenness, with different extent of chlorosis due to N deficiency and CL-induced interveinal chlorosis were used. Five measurements were taken per leaf and averaged to provide a single CCI per leaf. The adaxial side of the ...A wide range of studies have demonstrated that, when calibrated, chlorophyll meters such as the Konica Minolta SPAD-502+, Opti-Sciences CCM-200, Apogee Instruments MC-100, and METOS DUALEX can provide accurate estimates of LCC for various plant species (Cerovic et al., 2012; Coste et al., 2010; Demarez et al., 1999; Markwell et al ...The SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter provides a rapid and non-destructive estimation of leaf chlorophyll density [31] and is widely used to monitor the N status of plants [39] and optimise N fertilizer management in rice [27], [48], [10], [20], [42].The SPAD-502 meter is a hand-held device that is widely used for the rapid, accurate and non-destructive measurement of leaf chlorophyll concentrations. It has been employed extensively in both research and agricultural applications, with a range of different plant species.

We compared biomass estimates for individual trees, plots, and at the landscape-scale using our locally-developed allometric equations, nationwide equations applied across the U.S., and the Forest Inventory and Analysis Component Ratio Method (FIA-CRM).Building on a LiDAR biomass index (LBI) developed for use with terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data, we successfully developed an improved and robust LBI-based approach to estimate forest AGB at both individual tree and plot levels while minimizing the effort required for field data collection. This approach was tested for larch ...Direct measurement of the AGB of a tree requires that the tree be harvested and weighed to determine the total dry biomass of all its aboveground components.It was undertaken over the same site as the AfriSAR campaign from December 2017 to January 2018. A total of 27 plots were randomly sampled. Each measured 30.8 × 30.8 m, the size of which differed from those of the AfriSAR campaign (1-ha). Within each plot, the total number of trees (Na) were counted. Bole (trunk) diameters (D, cm) were ...We used plot data from temperate and tropical forest ecosystems to verify the effectiveness of the method, reconstructing a 1300 m 2 temperate plantation plot and a 5000 m 2 mingled forest plot, respectively.The total dry biomass was observed maximum in 5 × 4 m (244.52 Mg ha −1) and lowest in North–South boundary plantation (83.36 Mg ha −1). Moreover, 5 × 4 m planting geometry had proven superior in terms of higher biomass production than other planting geometries. The total biomass in different planting geometries followed the ...Based on field observations from Nepal’s national forest inventory of 2010–2014; the data set includes estimates for two major forest carbon pools, aboveground biomass (AGB) and soil organic...Introduction. Forest biomass (e.g., its storage, distribution, and dynamics) is crucial in monitoring the terrestrial carbon cycle, quantifying the renewable biomass resources, and evaluating other forest ecosystem services. Information on the distribution of forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is fundamental for decision-making in ...In this study, we evaluated the capability of terrestrial light detection and ranging (lidar) data in estimating field maize biomass at the plot, individual plant, leaf group, and individual organ (i.e., individual leaf or stem) levels.The standing above-ground biomass (AGB) of these forests constitutes about 80 % of terrestrial AGB, which amounts to 432 billion Mg of dry matter, (averaging 109 Mg ha −1; ). Within the forested area, increases in AGB (carbon) occur through growth, with rates of uptake greater for forests in the early stages of regeneration but ...

1. Introduction Biomass is an important measure of ecosystem productivity and is highly related to ecosystem structure and function ( Lohbeck et al., 2015 ). About 90% of the total aboveground biomass (AGB) of the terrestrial ecosystem is stored within forests ( Dixon et al., 1994; Guo et al., 2010 ).On a plot-level (a fixed size of 32 m × 32 m), approximately 97%, 93%, and 75% of individual trees could be recorded in easy (ca. 700 stems/ha), medium (ca. 900 stems/ha), and difficult stands (ca. 2, 200 stems/ha), respectively, using five-scan ), promising digitization can be expected for 87%, 69%, and 55% of individual trees in easy, medium a...The total biomass of 153 trees in the plantation plot was overestimated by 17.12 %, and the total biomass of 61 trees in the mingled forest plot was underestimated by 10.88 %. This method has the potential to be applied to a larger area, even if the requirements for memory and calculation time may increase with the increase of the ...Total aboveground biomass (kg/ha) Note: If harvesting all biomass in the harvest area is not possible, there is an alternative method of sampling a representative number of stems (e.g. 50 stems) to determine harvest index and estimate biomass from grain yield and harvest index.Total fresh grain weight (g) × Dry weight of grain subsample (g)] × 10,000 (5) Fresh weight of grain (g) Net harvest area (m2) 1000 Dry weight of chaff (kg/ha) = Dry weight of chaff (g) × 10,000 (6) 1000 Net harvest area (m2) Step 2: alculation of dry weight of biomass Dry weight of biomass (kg/ha) = [Total fresh biomass weight (g) ×where, B = Total tree biomass (kg), Bs = Stem biomass (kg), Bb = Branch biomass (kg), and Bf = Foliage biomass (kg) Forest soil organic carbon (SOC) Forest soil samplingStep 3: alculation of total aboveground biomass (oven-dried weight) and harvest index Total aboveground biomass (kg/ha) = Dry weight of grains (kg/ha) + Dry weight of straw (kg/ha) (7) Harvest index = Dry weight of grains (kg/ha) (8) Total aboveground biomass (kg/ha) ontributorThe results showed that terrestrial lidar data were useful for estimating maize biomass at all levels (at each level, R 2 was greater than 0.80), and biomass estimation at leaf group level was the most precise (R 2 = 0.97, RMSE = 2.22 g) among all four levels. All four regression techniques performed similarly at all levels.that biomass is uniformly distributed within the canopy projection, which is simple but not realistic. It was not until Kleinn et al. [27] and Pérez-Cruzado et al. [28] constructedplot was overestimated by 17.12 %, and the total biomass of 61 trees in the mingled forest plot was under- estimated by 10.88 %. We found that the uncertainty of aboveground biomass estimation in ...

The weight remaining is the dry matter (dm) of the sample. In this method, the temperature is sufficiently low enough for the sugars not to burn. When the sample contains a small amount of sugar (<4-5%), the 'normal' drying method can be used: a fixed amount of sample is dried in a drying oven at 103°C to a constant weight (> 4 hours).Dry matter is measured in the laboratory. A weighed sample of the substance mixture (sometimes called fresh mass) is taken and heated to over 100°C in the drying room in order to evaporate the residual moisture (mostly water). The remaining dry residue is weighed and proportioned.Dry matter refers to material remaining after removal of water, and the moisture content reflects the amount of water present in the feed ingredient. The nutrients in feeds, required by the animal for maintenance, growth, pregnancy, and lactation, are part of the DM portion of the feed.Dry matter (DM) is defined as the remaining proportion of the sample after drying to constant weight at a defined temperature and after compensation for loss of volatile compounds in certain feeds (e.g. silage).Dry Matter or Total Solids refers to the percentage of material remaining after removal of water. The animal feed, pet food, and forage industry uses the term “dry matter.” The human food, water, manure and compost industry uses the term “total solids.”The dry matter or dry weight is a measure of the mass of a completely dried substance. Analysis of food The dry matter of plant and animal material consists of all its constituents excluding water. The dry matter of food includes carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants (e.g., thiocyanate, anthocyanin, and quercetin ).Objectives of this study were 1) to compare fixed-time hand rinsing to fixed-time machine rinsing, 2) to evaluate effects of length of machine rinsing, and 3) to evaluate effects of numbers of bags simultaneously rinsed on DM remaining, DM disappearance, and their SE.The remaining dry matter consists of carbon (C), oxygen, hydrogen (H) and small amounts of sulphur (S), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg). Although present in small amounts, these nutrients are very important from the viewpoint of soil fertility management.Dry matter accumulation (DMA) and dry matter partitioning (DMP) are important physiological processes determining crop yield formation (Kumar et al., 2006). In agro-ecosystems, crop yield is not only dependent on DMA, but also closely related to efficient allocation of dry matter to harvested organs ( Zhang et al., 2019 ).Most of the remaining dry matter (i.e., 10–20% w/w) is composed of soluble sugars (e.g., fructose, glucose, sucrose, sorbitol) and more complex soluble and insoluble polysaccharides such as ...

operation (September 28, 2020). The cotton stalk moisture content was maintained in its natural state from its time in the field. The average value of the cotton stalk moisture content was 66.4%. Tests were carried out immediately after the samples were taken, and all of the mechanical measurements were performed in a laboratory setting usingIn this paper, the friction characteristics of cotton stalks were studied using response surface methodology, and the influence of the variation in contact materials, sampling location, and moisture content on the static sliding friction coefficient (ms) and stable static rolling angle (js) were analyzed.(moisture content, particle size, bulk density and porosity) of corn cobs, leaves and stalks were determined in this study. The moisture contents were 6.38, 7.92 and 6.40% of the cobs, leaves and stalks, respectively. The cobs had the highest weight percentage (18.23%) of the small particles (<0.212 mm) and the leaves hadChopped cotton stalks having a moisture content varying from 8.5% to 21.45% (w.b.) were densified into square blocks (80 mm by 80 mm) at compression pressures ranging between 13.79 and 34.47 MPa and a dwell time of 1 min, using a vertical compaction machine. Physical characteristics of blocks, namely bulk density, compression ratio ...In this study, a hyperspectral imaging system has been developed to evaluate and visualize the Brix values and moisture contents in sugarcane stalks to be used as a tool for breeding programmes. After extracting the spectral data via ENVI coding, data in the wavelength range of 450–950 nm were used to generate prediction models for ...The moisture content of the fresh cotton stalks was 46.13% to 69.8% wet basis. During the field sampling performed on 8 October, 2021, cotton plants with few branches, no damage, good straightness, and small variation in main stem diameter were selected as test samples.Stalks with mean moisture content of 70.05 ± 2.42%, 48.12 ± 1.19%, 28.14. ±2.02% and 18.14 ± 2.22% were subjected to cutting using three ground speeds (2.5 kmh −1, 5.0 kmh −1 and 7.5 kmh −1) and three machine speeds (30°, 45° and 60°), and the cutting properties—length of cut (LC) and length remaining in the soil (LS)—were measured with tape mea...It was concluded that an increase in moisture content of stem leads to a decrease in the tensile strength, bending stress, Young's modulus, torsional stress, modulus of rigidity and to an increase in shear strength and shearing energy.It was observed that the maximum cutting energy of 583.37 kJ were observed for 26 mm stalk girth with 10 ±5 % (w.b) moisture content and minimum cutting energy of 72.32 kJ was observed at 30 ± 5 % (w.b) moisture content (w.b) for 14 mm stalk girth.Particle size and moisture content also affected the SV of fungi. The highest SV 2.55 after 20 days of pretreatment was observed in 5 mm cotton stalk particles at 75% moisture content (Table 1). The SV decreased to 2.15, when particle size of cotton stalks decreased to 1 mm with 75% moisture content, due to the high cellulose loss ...

Crop yield is a standard measurement of the amount of agricultural production harvested—yield of a crop—per unit of land area. Crop yield is the measure most often used for cereal,...Crop yields are the harvested production per unit of harvested area for crop products. In most of the cases yield data are not recorded, but are obtained by dividing the production data by the data on area harvested.The order of operations can vary but this procedure calculates yields via the follow steps: 1) adjust harvested grain moisture to standard moisture, 2) convert harvested area to acres, 3) calculate pounds per acre, 4) calculate bu ac-1 (or convert to SI units). Yields need to be calculated independently for every experimental unit (e.g., plot).Cereal yield vs. fertilizer use; Cereal yields; Change in cereal production, yield, land use and population; Crop yields; How much cropland has the world spared due to increases in crop yields? Almond yields; Area of land needed to meet global vegetable oil demand; Area of land needed to produce one tonne of vegetable oil; Banana yields; Barley ...In this method, yield in one or more subplots is measured and total yield per unit area is calculated as total production divided by total harvested area in the crop cut plot or subplot. The number of sub-plots and area of each sub-plot to be selected for yield estimation through crop cuts depends on the resources availability and level of ...the crop was produced. The estimation of yield can be calculated using kernel weight at harvest, plot area harvested, plant density, and moisture content of grain at harvest. For instance, to get the full expression of maize yield potential, the plants must be at optimum density. In some circumstances,Crop yields in alley cropping decreased on average with 2.6% per year over the first 21 years of the tree stand, indicating increasing competitive effects of the trees with their age.Under the higher yield levels (>15 Mg/ha), the average grain yield, DM, and HI were 16.91 Mg/ha (range: 15.03–20.70 Mg/ha), 30.71 Mg/ha (range: 22.06–38.83 Mg/ha), and 0.54 (range: 0.43–0.64), respectively; under the lower yield levels (<15 Mg/ha), the average grain yield, DM, and HI were 10.15 Mg/ha (range: 3.43–14.99 Mg/ha), 22.35 Mg ...Crop yield (production per unit harvested area) is an essential variable in many disciplines. Global yield datasets for the historical past have increasingly been used to analyze...Grain yield (kg/ha) = [(sample Yield per plot (kg) x 10,000)] / [(number sub-samples x segment length (metres) x row spacing (metres)] For example, if 2 kilograms are harvested from 20 measured segments in a plot, each segment is 2 metres long, and average row spacing is 0.75 metres then:

the leaching of dissolved organic matter contained in standing dead leaves (Angst et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2017). Due to the low temperature in winter, micro-bial activity is expected to be limited. Both micro-bial activity and abiotic processes can inuence the decomposition of standing dead leaves. It is currentlyHere, the authors turn dead leaves into an active material which acts as bioplastic and shows high performance in solar water evaporation, photocatalytic H2 production and antibiotic...Leaf dry matter content, also known as the leaf mass per area (LMA), is an indicator of vegetation growing condition. It is defined as the ratio of leaf dry mass to leaf area (unit, g / c m 2 ), and is widely used a key parameter for studies of terrestrial ecosystem monitoring ( Schimel et al., 2015 ), species identification ...Plant litter (also leaf litter, tree litter, soil litter, litterfall or duff) is dead plant material (such as leaves, bark, needles, twigs, and cladodes) that have fallen to the ground. This detritus or dead organic material and its constituent nutrients are added to the top layer of soil, commonly known as the litter layer or O ...In this study, with the increase of dust deposition on leaves, the dry matter content and tissue density of leaves increased significantly. This shows that plants use more resources for the construction of defense structures in order to reduce the damage degree of leaves.Understanding the rate at which leaves decay can help scientists predict this global flux of carbon dioxide, and develop better models for climate change. But this is a thorny problem: A single leaf may undergo different rates of decay depending on a number of variables: local climate, soil, microbes and a leaf’s composition.In terrestrial ecosystems, fungi and bacteria that enter soils with dead leaves often play prominent roles in decomposition, but their role in aquatic decomposition is less known. Here, we test ...Based on the very limited empirical data available, we hypothesized that variation in species traits including leaf (litter) pH, within and between ecosystems contrasting in soil pH, would have stronger effects on leaf litter decomposition rates than variation in soil chemistry would.Leaf dry matter content (LDMC) is widely used as an indicator of plant resource use in plant functional trait databases. Two main methods have been proposed to measure LDMC, which basically differ in the rehydration procedure to which leaves are subjected after harvesting.Total dry matter yield in sweet sorghum is positively correlated with total leaf area, leaf area index (LAI), at anthesis (Ferraris, 1981). LAI also appeared to have a direct influence on Brix ( Choudhari et al., 1987 ).

This briefing presents the information on soil carbon that can be extracted from the 2021 national greenhouse gas inventories, as reported by EU Member States for the year 2019. It also gives an overview on the status of soil carbon pools across Europe.Integrated to a depth of 1 m, global soil carbon has a mean age of 4,830 ± 1,730 yr, with older carbon in deeper layers and permafrost regions. In contrast, vertically resolved land models ...Soil carbon (C) plays a key role in mitigating and adapting to global climate change. In-situ soil C measurement has faced many challenges including those related to aerial coverage, economics, accuracy, and availability.In this study, we take advantage of a global data set of SOC measurements in 113,013 soil profiles across the globe 29 which includes 2,703 soil profiles in the northern hemisphere permafrost ...Abstract. Sustainable soil carbon sequestration practices need to be rapidly scaled up and implemented to contribute to climate change mitigation. We highlight that the major potential for carbon ...That paper concluded by presenting a future vision for a global framework to assess soil carbon change, based on a combination of mathematical models, spatial data to drive the models, short- and long-term data to evaluate the models, and a network of benchmarking sites to verify estimated changes.How to measure, report and verify soil carbon change to realize the potential of soil carbon sequestration for atmospheric greenhouse gas removal. Glob. Chang Biol. 26 , 219–241 (2020).Abstract. This review covers the current and emerging analytical methods used in laboratory, field, landscape and regional contexts for measuring soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in agricultural soil. Soil depth plays an important role in estimating SOC sequestration.This chapter explores those issues and discusses various SOC measurement methods. Soil organic carbon is an extremely important soil health indicator because it influences almost all soil biological, chemical, and physical properties and processes. Development of conservation agriculture practices has increased SOC.

Ground cover was estimated from LiDAR using two methodologies: red reflectance image and canopy height. In contrast to NDVI, LiDAR was not affected by saturation at high ground cover, and the comparison of both LiDAR methodologies showed strong association (r2 = 0.92 and slope = 1.02) at ground cover above 0.8. For above-ground ...Leaf area index is the one-sided, green leaf area of a canopy or plant community per unit ground area. To directly measure LAI, you would have to measure the area of each leaf in the canopy above a unit of ground area. Because this method is both destructive and incredibly time consuming, it is rarely used. All other measurements ofmean NAR, instantaneous NAR can be estimated by calculating rate of dry matter accumulation at time t (i.e., by differentiating the "growth curve" at time = t) and measuring LAI at time = t.

The crop thus reaches its full production potential under the given environment. The crop water need mainly depends on:In the crop coefficient approach the crop evapotranspiration, ET c, is calculated by multiplying the reference crop evapotranspiration, ET o, by a crop coefficient, K c : ET c = K c ET o (56) where ET c crop evapotranspiration [mm d -1 ], K c crop coefficient [dimensionless], ET o reference crop evapotranspiration [mm d -1 ].The average estimation accuracy of percentage ground cover from WDVI was of the same magnitude as that of the conventional methods, i.e. about 5 per cent (absolute value) for potato and beet for the whole growing season, and about 5 per cent at low ground cover to 10-12 per cent at high ground cover for the cereals in the vegetative ...K cb full can be adjusted for tree crops by multiplying by a reduction factor (F r) estimated using a mean leaf stomatal resistance term.

Greater recovery of roots and more predictable recovery of the active microbial biomass across the high diversity management strategy chronosequence corresponded with faster recovery of soil structure.The average resistance and recovery rate of evergreen and deciduous forests during moderate droughts exhibited high spatial variability in China’s forest ecosystems ( Fig. 3 a, b). Highly resistant forests had a low recovery rate, whereas forests with low resistance had a high recovery rate.We identified trees, shrubs and vines ≥2.5 cm DBH in a chronosequence comprising 33 sites, aged 3–60 yr since the formation of closed canopy (9–69 yr since pasture abandonment) and compared them with eight sites in nearby mature forest remnants.We also found that soil water content around dominant slow-growing species was 1.5–3 times greater than for fast-growing species in both seasons. Therefore, reforestation based on monoculture plantings of fast-growing species seems difficult to effectively recover the soil water content.The LD indices (e.g., LD 50), reflecting plant dehydration tolerance, varied with all the tested factors, revealing that plant survival and post-drought recovery depend on VPD levels and plant–plant interactions for a given plant species and population.Assessments of the restoration performance over different ecosystems worldwide show that, when traditional restoration guidelines based on the recovery of those simple metrics are followed; (1)...The present article reviews available literature on the recovery process examined in various plant species, in response to several metals (Al, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn), applied at different concentrations and treatment duration. The reviewed studies have been carried out in laboratory conditions.It follows that assessment of plant recovery, as is commonly performed after a given number of days of dehydration, may identify survival mainly by way of dehydration avoidance, while the resolution of dehydration tolerance requires normalized RWC at the point of recovery.Moreover, there are various examples from other species including algae, plants, insects, marine invertebrates and humans where the proportion surviving to maximum age is also equal or close...

This theory, narrowed down to sugar nutrients, states that a minimal level of sugar assimilates needs to reach the apex (flowering) or lateral bud (removal of apical dominance) before floral transition or lateral bud outgrowth is initiated.This paper shows data of sugarcane stem height on plots selected by reflectance sensor during two growing seasons compared to biomass accumulation and N-uptake on commercial sugarcane fields ...grower will be discussed.

Canopy height 1. Introduction The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is the first spaceborne lidar mission optimized for high-resolution ecosystem structure measurements within the coverage of International Space Station (ISS).A new, 30-m spatial resolution global forest canopy height map was developed through the integration of the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation ( GEDI) lidar forest structure measurements and Landsat analysis-ready data time-series.3) Canopy height showed high heritability from all datasets, and 3D sensing datasets had even higher heritability (H2 = 0.79–0.89) than FM (field measurement) (H2 = 0.77). Finally, outliers of different datasets are analyzed. The results provide novel insights into different methods for canopy height measurement that may ensure the ...Canopy Height Model (CHM): the height or residual distance between the ground and the top of the of objects above the ground. This includes the actual heights of trees, builds and any other objects on the earth’s surface. This CHM is created by subtracting the DTM from the DSM.Canopy height serves as a good indicator of forest carbon content. Remote sensing-based direct estimations of canopy height are usually based on Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometric data.We selected four pine stands to assess the effect of horizontal resolution on lidar-based canopy height measurement. The case studies represented stands with: (1) dense, homogeneous canopy cover; (2) small gaps; (3) narrow, linear gaps between planted rows; and (4) large, irregularly shaped gaps.Here we present a comprehensive global canopy height map at 10 m ground sampling distance for the year 2020. We have developed a probabilistic deep learning model that fuses sparse height...Methods for measuring the height of trees mainly include traditional measurements and remote sensing inversions. Traditional canopy height measurement relies on the manual use of optical measuring instruments (e.g., altimeters or laser range finders) to calculate the height of trees.

I am not quite sure if it is possible to use the formula: RGR (H)= (H2-H1)/H/ (t2-t1) where H is the mean of plant height during the period (t2-t1), which is modified from plant relative...Plant growth rate can be measured as the relative increase in leaf area over time, by substituting total plant leaf area for total biomass in the conventional RGR equation. RGR A = (ln LA 2 −ln LA 1) / ( t 2 − t 1) (6.14)Modelling individual plant growth. The strategy of modelling individual plant growth is straightforward: 1) A suitable function of relative growth rate is selected from Table 1 or from other publications. 2) A primary plant size characteristic is identified, e.g. tree volume.In the case of two harvests, RGR can be simply calculated as [3] [4] In the case of more harvests, a linear equation can be fitted through the ln-transformed size data. The slope of this line gives an estimate of the average RGR for the period under investigation, with units of g.g −1 .day −1.We demonstrate a variety of nonlinear models that are appropriate for modelling plant growth and, for each, show how to calculate function-derived growth rates, which allow unbiased comparisons among species at a common time or size. We show how to propagate uncertainty in estimated parameters to express uncertainty in growth rates ...time that passed between the two height measurements. For example, if you measured a plant that was 3 cm tall on Day 4 and 10 cm tall on Day 6, you would have: Growth Rate = (10 cm – 3 cm)/(6 days – 4 days) = 7 cm/2 days = 3.5 cm/day. The unit of time here is days. For any type of rate equation, a change in time will always be used. TheThe simplest index of plant growth; a rate of change in size, an increment in size per unit time. Most commonly applied to total dry weight or total leaf area per plant. Symbol and definition G, the rate of increase of total dry weight per plant, W. Dimensions and units MT-\ e.g. gday-1. Formulae Instantaneously, G = d Wjdt.At the ecosystem level, growth is often conceptualised as net biomass accumulation per unit land surface area and time. In this paper, we review these various facets of plant growth at different levels from cells to organs, plants, and ecosystems (the ‘what’). We emphasize that each facet can be defined using corresponding ...The leaf area index can be used to calculate the instantaneous crop growth rate (at any time t) which serves as a simple index of agricultural productivity. This is defined as (2.12) C = E×L= 1 P × dW dt = 1 s 1 dW dt × s 1 P and is expressed in terms of the weight per unit area and time (Kg m −2 s −1).The simplest index of plant growth; a rate of change in size, an increment in size per unit time.

Around 68% of heights will fall within one standard deviation of the mean height; 95% within two standard deviations; and 99.7% within three. If we know the mean and standard deviation of heights, we have a good understanding of how heights vary across a population.Here, standard deviation is a measure of how spread out human height is. A larger standard deviation means a greater variation in height. The standard deviation automatically set in the height percentile calculator is approximated from Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization data [1,2,3]. Specific countries will vary somewhat ...I am looking at the following: The average tallest men live in Netherlands and Montenegro mit 1.83 m= 183 cm. The average shortest men live in Indonesia mit 1.58 m= 158 cm. The standard deviation of the height in Netherlands/Montenegro is 9.7 cm and in Indonesia it is 7.8 cm.Health care professionals sometimes convert height, weight or body mass index (BMI) measurements to standard deviation scores (SDS). The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or spread of a set of values around the mean or average (also called the expected value).In a normal curve, there is a specific relationship between its “height” and its “width.” Normal curves can be tall and skinny or they can be short and fat. They are all symmetric, unimodal, and centered at \(\mu\), the population mean.Standard deviation (SD) for height by age (WHO 2006 growth standard) Source publication +1 Using height-for-age differences (HAD) instead of height-for-age z-scores (HAZ) for the...This means that most men (about 68%, assuming a normal distribution) have a height within 3 inches of the mean ( 67–73 inches ) – one standard deviation – and almost all men (about 95%) have a height within 6 inches of the mean ( 64–76 inches ) – two standard deviations.The standard normal distribution, also called the z-distribution, is a special normal distribution where the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. Every normal distribution is a version of the standard normal distribution that’s been stretched or squeezed and moved horizontally right or left.Published on September 17, 2020 by Pritha Bhandari . Revised on June 21, 2023. The standard deviation is the average amount of variability in your dataset. It tells you, on average, how far each value lies from the mean.Regarding the change in the height SDS from birth to 3 years of age, 33.4% of children increased more than 0.5 SDs, 39.8% of children decreased more than 0.5 SDs, and 34.4% of children remained within ±0.5 SDs. The change in height SDS displayed a strong positive correlation with the change in weight during the four periods.

TVD schemes develop formulae for interpolation of a cell-face value of the transported variable. If the interpolated value is bounded by the neighbouring nodal values then the scheme is ‘Bounded’. However, not all TVD schemes possess this property of ‘Boundedness’.this paper we propose some natural limitations on the interpolated values between two mesh points and we establish in the third part su cient conditions that prove that the resulting scheme is TVD.However, even second-order discretisation schemes, which at first appear to be inherently interpolative bounded, such as central differencing via linear interpolation to faces, can produce an oscillatory solution in regions of steep property gradient.Higher-order TVD interpolation in multi-dimension is developed. The major advantage of MHTVD (Multi-dimensional Higher-order TVD) is the com-plete multi-dimensional monotonic characteristics and it is possible to be more than 3rd order spatial accuracy. In addition, MHTVD shows good con-vergence characteristics and is computationally eﬃcient ...The TVDal scheme has also been applied to model tidally induced internal lee waves, indicating that TVDal has the potential ability to balance the numerical compression and diffusion of conventional TVD schemes for cases with highly nonlinear, stratified, and nonhomogeneous flow fields.A numerical scheme is presented for accurate simulation of fluid flow using the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) on unstructured mesh. A finite volume approach is adopted to discretize the LBE on a cell-centered, arbitrary shaped, triangular tessellation.Taking advantage of FUNWAVE-TVD model's capacity to employ rapidly varying terrains and steep slopes in the surf zone, this study provides significant insights into the sediment transport dynamics in a variety of coastal engineering applications.This article discusses adjusting inverse distance interpolation for use in unstructured mesh finite volume solutions. The adjustment was made on the weight function of the inverse distance ...Present a numerical technique that is based on IMM coupled with TVD scheme to solve the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with heat transfer. Show that this TVD–IMM algorithm gives a very good results even at high Rayleigh numbers.The interpolated primitive variables on cell boundaries are determined by using the third-order MUSCL method. The solution of the fluid flow is advanced in time by using the second-order TVD Runge–Kutta scheme. The proposed coupling method updates the burning surface and grid classification once when the movement distance is ...

Because wells are not always drilled vertically, there may be two "depths" for every given point in a wellbore: the measured depth (MD) measured along the path of the borehole, and the true vertical depth (TVD), the vertical distance between the datum and the point of interest.Typically, the maximum inclination is reduced to zero at Dt with drop radius R1, derived in the same manner as the build radius, R.

In numerical methods, total variation diminishing (TVD) is a property of certain discretization schemes used to solve hyperbolic partial differential equations. The most notable application of this method is in computational fluid dynamics. The concept of TVD was introduced by Ami Harten.Where: MAASP = Maximum allowable annular surface pressure (psi) MW = Mud weight in hole (SG) Pleak = Leak-off pressure at the open hole weak point (psi) SF = Safety factor (psi) TVDwp = Vertical depth at the open hole weak point (m) Or the TVD in feet and the coefficient is 0.433.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2023.116070.

Our study focuses on street trees that fork between 30 and 137 cm of height (hereafter “multi-stemmed trees”), which researchers have identified as particularly challenging in the ongoing development of urban allometric models, as well as consistency in measurements across space and time.Mikita et al. (2016) estimated d.b.h. and stem volume of 118 trees (mean d.b.h. = 38.16 cm) in a 0.8 ha forest stand, with tree density of 30 per cent of our plot. D.b.h. estimates used a circle-fitting method and stem volumes were calculated by an allometric equation.The SED of the 1.581 × 10 6 logs varied from 3 to 80 cm, where values larger than 60 cm were found only in 0.3% of the logs. The individual log length ranged from 2.2 to 26.4 m, but lengths longer than 6.4 and 12 m represented less than 0.50% and less than 0.01% of the logs, respectively (Fig. 3 ).Based on the measured tree heights and the counted number of stems in each quadrant, the dominant height of each plot was computed to conform to this definition.

In this article, an analytical model for predicting the Mach stem height is improved based on two main assumptions: one is the calculation of the triple point deflection angle when the Mach stem is an oblique shock and the other is about the shape of the free part of the slip line.27 March 2021 | Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering, Vol. 236, No. 1Abstract A new, more accurate prediction of Mach stem height in steady flow is presented. In addition, starting with a regular reflection in the dual-solution domain, the growth rate of the Mach...The Mach stem height is an important parameter in the Mach reflection of steady supersonic flow. Various experimental, numerical, and theoretical works have been conducted to study this parameter in the past. However, much of the established work focuses around a single set of trailing edge heights.Abstract The flow from a supersonic nozzle when operated at off-design conditions exhibits a wide variety of complex flow structures. The prominent ones are the shock reflections inside the jet. The two main types of shock interactions are the regular reflection (RR) and Mach reflection (MR).The Mach stem heights are decided solely for the incoming flow Mach numbers and the wedge angles by the improved analytical model. As a result, the Mach stem heights by the model of this article ...After the completion of data screening and filtering, there were 0.448 × 10 6 stems and 1.581 × 10 6 logs remaining in the final data set.

Biomethane is obtained by upgrading biogas produced by transforming biomass such as agricultural residues, biowaste or forest wood through anaerobic digestion or pyrogasification processes. This raises the question ofBiochemical methane potential prediction of plant biomasses: Comparing chemical composition versus near infrared methods and linear versus non-linear models - ScienceDirect Bioresource Technology Volume 175, January 2015, Pages 382-390In this investigation, optical (SPOT-7 NAOMI), airborne LiDAR, and PolInSAR L-band data, along with forest inventories, were employed to develop models for estimating total dry aboveground biomass (AGB) over the tropical forests in the Congo Basin (Gabon) of Central Africa.Technological advancements employed for the bio-adsorption of CO 2 and H 2 S such as scrubbing, swing adsorption, and cryogenic separation from biogas are articulated. • Modelling aspects for the adsorption of biogas for the enrichment of biomethane are discussed. •Each substrate was analysed in terms of dry matter (TS), volatile solids (TVS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total phosphorus (TP) according to the Standard Methods [25]. In particular TKN and TP have been processed through a high-performance Ethos-One microwave digestion system by Milestone (Italy ...Biomethane (also known as “renewable natural gas”) is a near-pure source of methane produced either by “upgrading” biogas (a process that removes any CO 2 and other contaminants present in the biogas) or through the gasification of solid biomass followed by methanation:Biomethane potentials ranged from 384 to 315 and from 412 to 283 NL CH 4 kg VS −1 (normal liters of methane per kg of volatile solids) for leaves and stems, respectively. About digestion kinetics, maximum daily production rate ( R max) was significantly affected by harvest time and not by plant partitioning.The biomethane yields per hectare of giant reed (m 3 CH 4 ha −1) was calculated as the product of biomethane potential and dry biomass yield expressed in volatile solid (gVS ha −1).Biomethane is a near-pure source of methane produced either by “upgrading” biogas or through the gasification of solid biomass; since it is indistinguishable from the regular natural gas stream, it can be transported and used wherever gas is consumed, but without adding to emissions.Aboveground biomass and biomethane potential were taken into account to evaluate methane yield per area unit. The area-specific methane yields had a mean of 119 L N CH 4 m −2 and a large range which was solely due to the variations in aboveground biomass (P < 0.001, η² = 97%) and not due to biomethane potentials (P = 0.600, η² ...

Agronomic and industrial characteristics related to the aboveground biomass (fresh and dry), chemical (sucrose, fiber, Brix, total recoverable sugar, extractives, ashes, lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose), and nutritional (macro- and micronutrients) composition were evaluated. Some energy cane genotypes presented higher dry biomass yield ...Above-ground biomass (AGB) is the total mass of material stored in the living stems, branches and leaves of vegetation, and is often described as a biomass density, with units of mass per unit area.The aboveground dry biomass yields of sugarcane and energy cane were 37.4 and 45.2 Mg ha −1, respectively, averaged across the two sites and three crops. The increased dry biomass yield for energy cane relative to sugarcane was mainly associated with stalk population (Zhao et al. 2017 ).Significant differences in growth and aboveground biomass were found in the monoculture wetlands. Species that showed faster growth and larger biomass in monoculture wetland were also dominant in the mixed wetland. The mixed wetland exhibited similar biomass and root growth to the averages of five monocultures.Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB), or carbon (AGC), in tropical forests has become a major concern for scientists and stakeholders. However, AGB assessment procedures are not fully standardized and even more importantly, the uncertainty associated with AGB estimates is seldom assessed.Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery (2023) Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) plays an important role in the study of the carbon cycle and climate change in the global terrestrial ecosystem. AGB ...Abstract. Crop traits such as aboveground biomass (AGB), total leaf area (TLA), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), and thousand kernel weight (TWK) are important indices in maize breeding. How to extract multiple crop traits at the same time is helpful to improve the efficiency of breeding.The fraction of plant biomass in aboveground versus root tissues has implications for carbon storage and dynamics. Here the authors collate a dataset on root-mass fractions and use these data to ...The living biomass of the world’s forests contains more than 40% of the global terrestrial carbon (C) stocks [ 1 ]. Globally, belowground biomass (BGB) is estimated to account for 20–26% of the total biomass, and as such it is an important C pool for many vegetation types and land-use systems.Results showed that aboveground biomass, belowground biomass and total biomass all increased with increasing growing season precipitation, as expected in this water-limited ecosystem. Biomass allocation patterns also changed along the precipitation gradient, but significant variation between species was apparent.

Introduction Starch is the most abundant component of cereal grains and an important structural constituent in cereal products. Starch and non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) are used together in food processing to improve the texture, water mobility, and stability of food products.CONACYT-Mexico In the last century, starch present in foods was considered to be completely digested. However, during the 1980s, studies on starch digestion started to show that besides digestible starch, which could be rapidly or slowly hydrolysed, there was a variable fraction that resisted hydrolysis by digesti …Starch was isolated from hydrothermally treated brown rice flour, and its molecular structure was related to starch digestibility as assessed using Englyst's test. The molecular weight of starch decreased due to two types of hydrothermal treatments (annealing [ANN] and heat-moisture treatment [HMT]), and the effect was higher when ...Introduction It is estimated that 60.2 million households in the US own a dog, with a dog population close to 94.2 million ( APPA, 2017 ). Most pet foods can be divided into three categories based on moisture content: dry, semi-wet or soft-moist, and canned ( Kvamme and Phillips, 2003 ).Abstract. The digestion of starch-based foods in the small intestine as well as factors affecting their digestibility have been previously investigated and reviewed in detail. Starch digestibility has been studied both in vivo and in vitro, with increasing interest in the use of in vitro models.Chapter First Online: 10 October 2019 708 Accesses Abstract Structure is a fundamental factor in determining the way that digestible and non-digestible food carbohydrates (mono- and di-saccharides, oligo-saccharides and polysaccharides) influence a range of health outcomes.Driven by the immense functional and nutritional implications of starch–lipid binary interactions, this study is aimed at designing starch digestibility by controlling the interaction between starch and glycerol monostearate (GMS)/stearic acid (SA) using a hot-extrusion 3D printing (HE-3DP) environment.The starch digestibility has been shown to increase by 35–40% during cooking, autoclaving and puffing followed by pressure cooking and germination. They also reported that baking, frying and shallow frying reduced rapidly digestible starch (RDS) while roasting and pressure cooking enhanced the RDS to about 23% followed by cooking ...The in vitro starch digestion rate and estimated glycemic index (GI) of cereal starches were evaluated along with the impact of cooking on starch digestion. The cooking of starch slurries increased the rapidly digestible starch content from a range of 34.7–54.4% to a range of 60.5–78.5%.The first mathematical models to describe food digestibility have primarily focused on the wet mass retention ratio of the studied food (wet sample weight after digestion time, t, divided by the initial wet sample weight).The wet mass retention ratio has been observed to follow three distinct profiles (delayed sigmoidal, sigmoidal, and exponential; Figure 9.2), yet all three profiles can be ...

Cell wall residues in fibers are present throughout degraded regions of the cell wall under attacking by erosion bacteria. In the heavily degraded WAB (D), all the cell walls, even in the middle lamella, were depleted in the final stage of degradation. The corner middle lamella was the last structure to be attacked by bacteria (D ...Despite the utility of soybean cellulosic biomass and post-processing residues in biofuel generation, there is no comprehensive information available on cell wall loosening and degradation related ...Yeast cell wall (YCW) is a very rich waste from the yeast extract industry. Due to this, the aim of this work is to develop new biodegradable films based on residual YCW and the study of the effect of plasticization on films properties. Residual YCW was used as base matrix and different concentrations of glycerol (0, 15, 25 and 35 wt ...Trafficking-defective rabA mutants have already been shown to impact cell wall composition. To study the impacts of these mutants on cell wall digestion, we developed a saccharification process for Arabidopsis based on the hot water method.Cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) are a heterogeneous group of enzymes including glycosyl-hydrolases, oxidoreductases, lyases and esterases. Microbes with degrading activities towards plant cell wall polysaccharides are the most relevant source of CWDEs for industrial applications.The cell wall consists mainly of peptidoglycan (PG), a mesh of polysaccharide strands (composed of a poly-[N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc)] backbone) crosslinked via short peptide bridges attached to the MurNAc residues [7]. PG is synthesized on the external face of the cytoplasm. Synthesis steps include ...In this review, we highlight studies supporting the occurrence of plant cell-wall recycling, describe the processes that control wall turnover and metabolic salvage, discuss promising new tools for further investigating wall recycling, and speculate on developmental processes to which wall recycling might contribute, in order to ...The cell wall (CW) of bacteria is an intricate arrangement of macromolecules, at least constituted of peptidoglycan (PG) but also of (lipo)teichoic acids, various polysaccharides, polyglutamate and/or proteins. During bacterial growth and division, there is a constant balance between CW degradation and biosynthesis.While useful information about cell wall constituents could be obtained from such residues, their inherent disadvantages have often been overlooked. For example, most of the cytoplasmic proteins (from membranes, enzymes, etc.), nucleic acids and reserve polysaccharides like starch are co-precipitated with the residues in addition to ...Interestingly, pore traits of cell wall, especial for microcosmic interface structure, seemed to be a crucial factor that correlated to cellulase adsorption and further affected saccharification. Highly heterogeneity in cell wall traits influenced the overall saccharification efficiency of biomass. Furthermore, the holistic outlook ...

We contrast a new continuous approach (CA) for estimating plot-level above-ground biomass (AGB) in forest inventories with the current approach of estimating AGB exclusively from the tree-level AGB predicted for each tree in a plot, henceforth called DA (discrete approach). With the CA, the AGB in a forest is modelled as a continuous ...Estimating above-ground biomass (AGB) accurately includes several steps, such as the assignment of a wood density value to a tree, the choice of a biomass allometric model or the choice of a height–diameter (H–D) model when tree height data are incomplete or absent.Above-ground biomass was determined from shoots cut at ground level from the central six rows of each plot along 1.0 m in length (sample area of 1.08 × 1.0 m = 1.08 m 2). The dry weight was determined from the samples after drying at 65°C until reaching a constant dry weight. LiDAR measurements with the Phenomobile Lite were obtained on the ...In this end we reviewed the present scenarios of above ground biomass estimation, focusing predominantly on field measurement (destructive and non-destructive) and remote sensing (optical...Biomass across the 1.56 million ha study area and uncertainties were similar for local (2.1 billion Mg; % RMSE = 97%) and nationwide (2.2 billion Mg; % RMSE = 94%) equations, while FIA-CRM estimates were lower and more uncertain (1.5 billion Mg; % RMSE = 165%). ConclusionsThe standing above-ground biomass (AGB) of these forests constitutes about 80 % of terrestrial AGB, which amounts to 432 billion Mg of dry matter, (averaging 109 Mg ha −1; ). Within the forested area, increases in AGB (carbon) occur through growth, with rates of uptake greater for forests in the early stages of regeneration but slowing ...Biomass was measured at plot level at eight contrasting sites to test the accuracy of prediction of tonnes dry matter of above-ground biomass per hectare using different classes of allometric equations. A finer-scale analysis tested performance of these at an individual-tree level across a wider range of sites. Although the ...In this investigation, optical (SPOT-7 NAOMI), airborne LiDAR, and PolInSAR L-band data, along with forest inventories, were employed to develop models for estimating total dry aboveground biomass (AGB) over the tropical forests in the Congo Basin (Gabon) of Central Africa.We used two different data sets of field plots for calculating aboveground biomass, National Forest Inventory (NFI) plots sampled between 2009 and 2014 and Intensive Carbon Monitoring (ICM) plots sampled in 2014 and 2015.Using an extensive database of 110 897 AGB measurements from field inventory plots, we show that the spatial patterns and magnitude of AGB are well captured in our map with the exception of regional uncertainties in high-carbon-stock forests with AGB >250 Mg ha−1, where the retrieval was effectively based on a single radar observation.

The dry weight was determined from the samples after drying at 65°C until reaching a constant dry weight. LiDAR measurements with the Phenomobile Lite were ...In this end we reviewed the present scenarios of above ground biomass estimation, focusing predominantly on field measurement (destructive and non-destructive) and remote sensing (optical remote ...Abstract. Complexity of forest structure is an important factor contributing to uncertainty in aboveground biomass estimates. In this study, we present a new method for reducing uncertainty in forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation based on plot-level terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) point clouds reconstruction.Biomass was measured at plot level at eight contrasting sites to test the accuracy of prediction of tonnes dry matter of above-ground biomass per hectare using different classes of allometric equations. A finer-scale analysis tested performance of these at an individual-tree level across a wider range of sites. Although the ...The plot AGB was converted to per hectare biomass (Mg/ha).

The Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program (TNSFP) is the largest ecological restoration project in the world, and has been ongoing for over 40 years. In this study, we developed models to estimate the planted forest aboveground biomass (PF_AGB ...

Following the nitrogen determination, crude protein content is calculated using a conversion factor. The original, and still frequently used, conversion factor 6.25 is based on an assumption that the general nitrogen content in food proteins is 16% and that all nitrogen in foods is protein-bound.We found that only six genera offer pollen with low protein concentration (crude protein < 20%), including two main crop species: sunflowers (Helianthus: median around 15%) and maize (Zea: median around 16%). Most other plant genera offer pollen of comparable protein concentration (Fig. 2).Simple linear regression equations to predict indispensable amino acids (% on a dry matter basis) using concentration of crude protein (% on a dry matter basis) in soybean meals (n = 64). …The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary crude protein (CP) concentrations, grain types and arginine:lysine ratios on performance parameters of broiler chickens.

An essential variable in the context of terrestrial carbon fluxes is aboveground biomass (AGB) density, usually defined as the aboveground standing dry mass of live or dead matter, and typically expressed as mass per unit area (e.g. Mg ha −1) for mapped products (Duncanson et al., 2021).Above ground biomass (AGB) is defined as “the aboveground standing dry mass of live or dead matter from tree or shrub (woody) life forms, expressed as a mass per unit area” , typically Mg ha –1. Urban trees can account for up to 97% of urban AGB . AGB can only be directly measured with destructive harvesting, an expensive and ...We set out to answer whether a 50% reduction in incident rainfall would reduce above ground dry matter (biomass) production; alter the biomass proportions from different plant functional types; and reduce regrowth of vegetation after a summer hay cut. The rainfall manipulation experiment was set up as part of the Drought Risk and You ...Dead aboveground biomass has a great effect on shading, and may cause a serious internal competition for light resources (Tanaka et al., 2016). The quality of harvested roughage may also be degraded by dead aboveground biomass. Thus, dead aboveground biomass was removed from all treatments at sites W and E on February 3 and 5 of 2015 ...Biomass, for the purposes of CEOS LPV, is defined as the dry mass of live or dead matter from tree or shrub (woody plant) life forms, typically expressed as a per area density (e.g. Mg of aboveground biomass per hectare). Thus, this does not include non-woody or belowground biomass.This indicator aims to monitor the amount of carbon stored in forests worldwide. Forests store carbon in their above- and belowground live biomass, dead wood and litter, and soils.In summary, plantlets transplanted during the first year led to an immediate reduction in dry matter concentration, recovering from the end of June onward (50 days after transplanting (DAT)) to reach values of about 400 and 500 mg g −1 for rhizome and aboveground biomass, respectively. In the second and third years, similar trends ...Dry matter of living (a, b) and dead (c, d) aboveground biomass above and below 7 cm of L. perenne at two levels of N fertilisation (Lp, LphighN) and of T. repens (Tr), under rainfed control...Aboveground live dry matter comprised 76% of the total live plus dead organic matter in these 10 stands, based on the FCP, so the contribution from dead organic matter was relatively small. Fig. 2 Relationship between measured dry matter (DM) stocks in Douglas-fir stands and adjusted predictions using the Forest Carbon Predictor (FCP)In this study, the aboveground dry matter (DM), the DM of different organs, and partition coefficients of a maize association mapping panel of 412 inbred lines were evaluated at the third and sixth leaf stages (V3 and V6). Further, the properties of these phenotypic traits were analyzed.

We conducted this study to evaluate the new in vitro system, DAISY II, to determine dry matter (DM) digestibility in ruminant feedstuffs. Results from the DAISY II were compared to those obtained by the traditional Tilly and Terry method. The traditional method buffer was used for both methods.The major result of our work highlighted that it was essential to carry out a gelatinization step to correctly estimate the in vitro dry matter digestibility of maize silage.

Normal potassium (K +) homeostasis maintains plasma K + concentration within a narrow range and is achieved by matching K + intake with excretion and ensuring proper distribution between extra- and intracellular fluid compartments.Potassium (K +) is the most abundant intracellular cation. Of the 3,500 mEq that constitute the total pool of the body, about 98% is confined to the intracellular fluid (ICF), at concentrations of 140-150 mEq/l, and only 2% (nearly 70 mEq) is located in the extracellular fluids (ECF), where it ranges from 3.5 to 5 mEq/l.Maintaining normal potassium (K +) concentrations in the extra- and intracellular fluid is critical for cell function. K + homeostasis is achieved by ensuring proper distribution between extra- and intracellular fluid compartments and by matching K + excretion with intake.Intracellular potassium concentration is 150 mmol/L (5.9 g/L), with the remainder present in the extracellular fluid. The extracellular fluid concentration of potassium is rather strictly maintained at a concentration of 3.5–5.5 mmol/L (137–215 mg/L).The average potassium concentration was found to be significantly higher in males \ ( (2846 \pm 525 \upmu g/g)\) compared to females \ ( (2116.2 \pm 432 \upmu g/g)\). We also observed a...Continuing Education Activity Potassium is an essential mineral constituent of the human body and is the chief cation found within the intracellular fluid of all cells. The chief indication for potassium administration is potassium deficiency or hypokalemia, a condition in which serum potassium level falls below a critical range.Potassium is the major cation in the ICF, and the intracellular potassium concentration is approximately 150 mmol l −1. In the ECF, however, the plasma potassium level normally ranges from only 3.5 to 5.0 mmol l −1 .Potassium, magnesium, calcium, urea, creatinine, bicarbonate and pH were measured from each blood test. Blood potassium concentrations values for each blood test are given in Table 2. ECG measurementsBy reviewing the general principles of bacterial membrane physiology and describing the molecular architecture and function of several bacterial K + -transporting systems, we aim to provide a framework for microbiologists studying bacterial potassium homeostasis and the many K + -translocating systems that are still poorly understood.The reference ranges for blood potassium levels are as follows [ 1] : Adult/elderly: 3.5-5.0 mEq/L or 3.5-5.0 mmol/L (SI units) Child: 3.4-4.7 mEq/L. Infant: 4.1-5.3 mEq/L. Newborn: 3.9-5.9 mEq/L. Results can be affected by diet, infusion of potassium-containing fluids, or an infusion of glucose or insulin.

In this work, a new spectroscopic method, called the CASA lignin method, was established for measuring the lignin content of lignocellulosic biomass by UV spectrophotometry, based on the full dissolution of whole biomass in 72% sulfuric acid (SA) containing the amino acid cysteine.Thus, solubility of lignin depends on absolute concentration of the base. The discussed results are consistent with the understanding of lignin dissolution as fractionation based on the acid–base properties of dissolving fractions.properties of lignin to absorb radiation in specific regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Because lignin has stronger absorbance to UV light at a wavelength of 280 nm than carbo-hydrates, UV-microspectrophotometry was applied to measure lignin concentrations in cell walls of specific plant tissues.28,29Lignin analysis: the analyses of the pre-dried KSW, KHW, OHW, and SOD lignins described above were performed by first accurately weighing approximately 30 mg of lignin to the nearest 0.1 mg. To the lignin, 0.3 mL of the CDCl 3 /pyridine mixture were added, along with 0.2 mL of DMF. Then, 0.1 mL each of the internal calibrant and ...We found a lignin content of 20.52 ± 7.7% (mean ± SD) in the fine roots of mixed grassland communities of the Jena Experiment. The 74 samples spanned a species gradient of 1–16 species from a ...The initial concentration of Va was always 10 mmol/L. Thus, the α -5-type condensation product between Va and Cr, 2- (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl)-6-methoxy-4-methylphenol ( VaCr, Fig. 3 ), was expected to form as the exclusive major product, at least in systems Cr50 and Cr75.They obtained removal efficiency of 90.2% and 79.4% of hemicellulose and lignin, respectively with an ethanol concentration of 61.7 g/L. Huang et al. (2018) , studied two crucial aspects of lignin-first biorefinery namely the catalyst regenerability and application of depolymerized products.We have also varied the initial lignin concentration for each lignin fraction and have attempted to understand the impact on the size, shape, and surface charge of the LNPs of factors such as the lignin origin, the Mw, the number of S/G units, the amounts of phenolic and aliphatic hydroxyl groups, β-O-4 bonds and the content of carbohydrate impu...The absorptivity at 280 nm has been employed by many authors to quantify the lignin concentration in a specific sample or solution.

open access • 23 Na MRI enables the quantification of tissue sodium concentration (TSC). • TSC quantification is primarily performed based on external reference phantoms. • Internal references have the potential to simplify 23Na MR imaging. • CSF and the vitreous humor as internal references on 50 stroke patients. •Scientific Reports - A method for estimating intracellular sodium concentration and extracellular volume fraction in brain in vivo using sodium magnetic resonance imagingDefinition Sodium concentration is maintained in a narrow range of 137 to 142 mEq/L of plasma. The value is 145 to 155 mEq/L of plasma water, a point to be noted because in a few circumstances there are significant changes in the plasma water concentration. Go to: TechniqueIn the combined data set plasma sodium level was significantly associated with ECFV (B [SE] = 0.10 [0.04], p = 0.02), and systolic blood pressure (SBP, B [SE] = 0.73 [0.26], p = 0.006), independent of ECFV. In conclusion, plasma sodium concentration is positively associated with ECFV on both LS and HS intake.Sodium is second only to protons in having the most sensitive biologically relevant MR signal. The considerably lower concentration (e.g. 35 mM sodium ions compared to 80M protons in human brain) and its four fold lower intrinsic sensitivity presented a significant barrier to early 23 Na MR imaging.Abstract. In this feasibility study we propose a method based on sodium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for estimating simultaneously the intracellular sodium concentration (C 1, in mM) and the extracellular volume fraction (α) in grey and white matters (GM, WM) in brain in vivo.The present investigation has addressed this issue by using ethyl isopropyl amiloride (EIPA), a specific and potent inhibitor of Na + -H + exchange ( Geibel et al. 1989 ), to assess the extent of Na + -H + exchange in loops of Henle perfused in vivo. The loop of Henle is a heterogeneous nephron segment.Tissue sodium concentration across the whole brain was estimated from sodium MRI maps acquired at 3 T and compared between 24 patients with Friedreich ataxia (21–57 years old, 13 females) and 23 controls (21–60 years old, 12 females).

NDF: neutral detergent fiber; IVDMD: in vitro dry matter digestibility; IVNDFD48: in vitro neutral detergent fiber digestibility after 48 h incubation. Concerning IVDMD, 10 AIBPs had medium to high values ( P < 0.05) ranging from 48.9% to 90.4%, while 5 AIBPs had noticeably low IVDMD that were less than 34% ( Table 2 and Fig. 2 c).Introduction Recently, forage testing laboratories have begun to evaluate forages for neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility. Evaluation of forages for NDF digestibility is being conducted to aid prediction of total forage digestibility. There are several important reasons why forages are being evaluated for NDF digestibility.Digestibility of NDF in vitro or in situ might be a better indicator of DMI than NDF digestibility in vivo because forages with high in vitro or in situ NDF digestibilities might have shorter rumen retention times, allowing greater DMI at the expense of NDF digestibility in vivo.A new in vitro lab assay has been developed that predicts total tract NDF digestion (TTNDFD) in ruminants. The test is based on a patented and licensed in vitro assay and model of fibre digestion. The in vitro TTNDFD assay is available through commercial labs and has been calibrated to NIR analysis.This work aimed to verify (i) whether the in vivo method with uNDF could be used to evaluate diet digestibility in growing pigs, and (ii) whether pre-treating the samples with neutral detergent solution (NDS) and α-amylase improves the accuracy of the estimates.The in vitro total-tract NDF digestibility ( TTNDFD) test predicts NDF digestion for alfalfa, corn silage, grass forages and byproduct feeds. UW-Madison researchers have validated the accuracy of the in vitro TTNDFD test against directly measured NDF digestibility in lactating dairy cattle.In vitro methods evaluated DM, N, and NDF digestibility and fermentability of 2 corn DDGS samples from U.S. (POET and ICM), 2 DDGS samples from Brazil (BR1 and BR2), 1 corn fiber and solubles sample (CF+S), 3 high protein distillers grains (HP-DDG) samples (BR-HP, US-HP, US-HPG1.5), and 2 HP-DDG samples containing high yeast (Ultramax; UM) and ...Method to measure in vitro neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility (ivNDFD) based on a primed rumen fluid inoculum.Rate of pdNDF digestion can be determined by measuring the degradation of NDF in ruminal in vitro or in situ incubations at multiple time points, and fitting the change in residual pdNDF by time with log-transformed linear first order or nonlinear mathematical treatments.In vitro neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility (NDFD) is an empirical measurement of fiber fermentability by rumen microbes. Variation is inherent in all assays and may be increased as multiple steps or differing procedures are used to assess an empirical measure.

In vitro incubations were performed under a randomized complete block design with four independent runs of each treatment.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro digestibility value of fermented cocoa pods using the NIRS method of feed analysis. This study used 18 samples of fermented cocoa shell waste, where the material used was fermented cocoa pod skin (KBK) then in vitro analysis was carried out. Samples were acquired spectrum by Thermo Integrative.The objective of the present study was to determine the precision with which laboratory and in situ measurements could predict the digestible organic matter in dry matter (DOMD) in vivo of mountain forages, using multiple linear, step-wise regression analyses.The meta-analysis results indicate that equations, containing apparent dry matter (DM) digestibility, total VFA production, propionate, valerate and feed type (forage vs. concentrate) resulted in best prediction of CH 4.Abstract. In vitro organic matter apparent digestibility (IVOMAD), true digestibility (IVOMTD), metabolizable energy (ME), net energy lactation (NEL), microbial nitrogen (MN) and synthesis of microbial biomass (MBM) were estimated to predict the nutritive values of some agricultural by-products, drought-tolerant range plants and browses.A simple technique for the determination in vitro of the dry- or organic-matter digestibility of small (0·5 g) samples of dried forages is described. It involves incubation first with rumen liquor and then with acid pepsin. Using 146 samples of grass, clover and lucerne of known in vivo digestibility ( Y ), the regression equation Y = 0·99 X ...

And most of that fresh water, 68 percent, is trapped in ice and glaciers. A third of the fresh ...Therefore, the optimal ratio of visible water to visible greenery ( WR / GR) is approximately 0.8. Deviation from this value reduces visual harmony and preference. When the value of WR / GR is too low, a moderate increase in the amount of visible water WR will improve visual harmony and preference.

Changes in concentrations of soluble sugars are a very rapid response of Arabidopsis to low temperature, occurring as quickly as 2 h after exposure to 1 °C ( Wanner & Junttila 1999 ).In today's context, the survival of plants under environmental stress is an extensive area of research. In addition, increase in the concentration of soluble sugars such as, glucose, sucrose and fructose enhances plant tolerance to several abiotic stresses, such as drought, salinity and cold (Rathinasabapathi, 2000).Soluble sugars, mostly comprised of glucose, fructose and sucrose, may be determined using refractometry or colorimetry. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is the mostly used technique for analysis of individual compounds ( Ma et al., 2014 ).Sensing intracellular soluble sugar pathways, however, provides incomplete information about the metabolic status of plant cells, since they ignore the concentration of soluble sugars in the apoplast and, perhaps more importantly, the apoplast-cytosol and the vacuole-cytosol fluxes of sugars. Consequently, a complex signalling network underlying to sugar-sensing pathways is present.The content and the ratio of soluble sugars and organic acids in fruits are significant indicators for fruit quality. They are affected by multiple environmental factors, in which water-deficient is the most concern. Previous studies found that the content of soluble sugars and organic acids in fruit displayed great differences under ...Soluble sugars are metabolic substrates that play a fundamental role in controlling several processes in diverse plant developmental phases. Sugars such as glucose, sucrose and fructose are reported throughout the plant kingdom and have a dominant role in structure and metabolism at the cellular and whole-plant level.At maturity, grape showed the highest soluble sugar concentrations (16.5–26.3 g/100 g FW), followed by peach (2.2 to 20 g/100 g FW) and tomato (1.4 to 5 g/100 g FW). Main processes determining soluble sugar concentration were decomposed into sugar importation, metabolism, and water dilution with the process-based analysis.Fruit species also showed a large diversity in soluble sugar concentration at maturity, with grape having the highest soluble sugar concentrations (16.5 to 26.3 g/100 g FW), followed by peach (2.2 to 20 g/100 g FW), cherry tomato (3.5 to 6.1 g/100 g FW), and tomato (1.4 to 5 g/100 g FW; Figure 1 ).The freezing tolerance and soluble sugar concentration of grape buds were measured monthly during the dormant season in the field and at 2wk, 4wk, and 6wk after ABA application in the greenhouse. It was observed that fructose, glucose, and sucrose are the main soluble sugars that correlate with freezing tolerance of grape buds and ...The use of phenol−sulfuric acid with a phenol concentration of 2% provided a relatively simple and reliable colorimetric method to quantify the total soluble-sugar concentration. Performing parallel sugar assays with and without phenol was more useful for accounting for the interfering effects of other substances present in plant ...

In energy cane production systems, however, dry biomass and its chemical composition are more important compared with fresh biomass. A better understanding of plant material ...Based on that, we developed two general equations valid for all varieties: SFB = 0.046 H × D1.5647 and AB = 0.4001 H × D1.0743. To calculate biomass per hectare, SFB and AB must be multiplied by ...Summary results for total biomass composition analysis on all 36 sugarcane samples utilised in this study are presented in Table 1. The percentage extractives on a DW basis fell between 12.9 and 73%. On an extractive free basis, or % of alcohol insoluble residue (AIR), the results were as follows, 14.5–31.3% cellulose, 9.9–25.5% ...Speciﬁc subject area Cropping systems of sugar cane in association with cover crops.

Sucrose levels ranging from 2000 to 8000 kg ha −1 were recorded between August and September of each year.Group B had higher fresh biomass, total dry matter percentages, and dry biomass-related traits. The IGH KGS 99-100 and ISHs GU 07-3704, KGS 2004-13, KGS 2004-186, KGS 2004-60 and 99-489 can be ...Df = degrees of freedom.. Standardization was done by division of aboveground biomass by the mean biomass per treatment. We obtained results from different linear mixed effects model analyses: treatment was fitted as a factor with four levels in model A and depicted into a year (2003 vs. 2017, according to Table 1), a soil history (− SH vs. + SH, according to Table 1) and a plant history ...

The root/shoot ratio (RSR) is the ratio of the belowground biomass to the aboveground biomass, which is the parameter that most directly reflects biomass allocation by plants. Many plants would change their RSR in response to shading or low nutrient availability ( Reynolds and D'antonio, 1996 ; Aphalo et al., 1999 ), so RSR is an ...Using data from 108 destructively harvested trees belonging to 36 miombo species, we estimated root to shoot ratios, and developed models for estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB), BGB and total biomass C stocks in the Copperbelt province of Zambia. We also validated our models using independent datasets from elsewhere in Zambia ...Mediterranean landscapes. This study developed and tested models to predict the belowground biomass and root/shoot ratio using aboveground field measures. The predictive power of such indirect measurement is useful for a rapid and reliable assessment of the biomass of the Mediterranean species.That is, plants will allocate relatively more biomass to roots if the limiting factor for growth is below ground (e.g. nutrients, water), whereas they will allocate relatively more biomass to shoots if the limiting factor is above ground (e.g. light, CO 2). The ‘functional’ aspect of this response is that it probably increases ...Step 1 Calculate biomass of VOB: = 300 m 3 /ha x 0.65 t/m 3 = 194 t/ha Step 2 Calculate the BEF (Eq. 3.1.4): BV > 190 t/ha, therefore BEF = 1.74 Step 3 Calculate aboveground biomass density (Eq. 3.1.1): = 1.74 x 300 x 0.65 = 338 t/ha. Example 2. Broadleaf forest with a VOB = 150 m 3 /ha and weighted average wood density, WD = 0.55 t/m 3Estimating above-ground biomass (AGB) accurately includes several steps, such as the assignment of a wood density value to a tree, the choice of a biomass allometric model or the choice of a height–diameter (H–D) model when tree height data are incomplete or absent.The present study aimed (1) to develop allometric equations to estimate the above- and below-ground biomass of L. sibirica trees, and (2) to estimate the root/shoot ratio applicable for estimating the root biomass based on above-ground biomass of natural larch forests in northern Mongolia.We developed an approach for harmonizing vegetation-specific maps of both above and belowground biomass into a single, comprehensive representation of each. We overlaid input maps and allocated ...It is not feasible to estimate the root to shoot ratio or develop a root biomass equation linking above-ground biomass to root biomass in the case of non-tree vegetation such as herbs, shrubs and grasses; with such plants, the soil core method is the one most commonly used for the purpose. The broad steps in estimating theFig. 7: Illustration of our main finding of warming effects on plant total biomass, above- and belowground biomass, and root:shoot ratio. a Biomes with low mean annual precipitation (MAP ...

The root/shoot ratio (RSR) is the ratio of the belowground biomass to the aboveground biomass, which is the parameter that most directly reflects biomass allocation by plants. Many plants would change their RSR in response to shading or low nutrient availability ( Reynolds and D'antonio, 1996 ; Aphalo et al., 1999 ), so RSR is an important ...Mediterranean landscapes. This study developed and tested models to predict the belowground biomass and root/shoot ratio using aboveground field measures. The predictive power of such indirect measurement is useful for a rapid and reliable assessment of the biomass of the Mediterranean species.The study estimates that roots make up 22% of total forest biomass, 47% of total shrubland biomass, and 67% of total grassland biomass. Globally, the below- ground portion of plants is 24%, meaning nearly a quarter of the carbon stored by plants world- wide is underground.Formulae display:? Globally, belowground biomass (BGB) accounts for 20–26% of total biomass, and as such it is an important carbon (C) pool for many vegetation types. However, large uncertainty exists for belowground biomass C compared to aboveground stocks.The present study aimed (1) to develop allometric equations to estimate the above- and below-ground biomass of L. sibirica trees, and (2) to estimate the root/shoot ratio applicable for estimating the root biomass based on above-ground biomass of natural larch forests in northern Mongolia.BIOMASS performs a number of standard tasks on input forest tree inventories: (i) tree species identification, if available, is automatically corrected; (ii) wood density is estimated from tree species identity; (iii) if height data are available, a local height–diameter allometry may be built; else height is inferred from pantropical or regiona...open access • 441 root:shoot records were compiled for 32 locations in south temperate forests. • Root:shoot ratios were size-invariant in most tree taxa assessed. • Most dicots had similar root:shoot ratios between south and north temperate forests. • Divergences in root allocation were only noted for gymnosperms and tree ferns. •Fig. 7: Illustration of our main finding of warming effects on plant total biomass, above- and belowground biomass, and root:shoot ratio. a Biomes with low mean annual precipitation (MAP ...Allometric equation Aboveground biomass Belowground biomass Regression equation Root to shoot ratio Seedling Sapling Species specific equation Tropical dry deciduous forest Abbreviations D diameter HA poor understanding of the fraction of global plant biomass occurring belowground as roots limits our understanding of present and future ecosystem function and carbon pools.

All crops required a lower herbicide intensity when grown in longer rotations: on average TFI decreased by 19% and 11% resp. depending on the location, and NAI decreased by 0.3 on average per year. Highest yields were harvested with a medium to high weed control target.The aim was to quantify the influence of the real-time application of variable herbicide rates on the amount of herbicides used, grain yield and late weed infestation. In 13 field trials average herbicide savings of 24.6% were achieved (cereals: 22.8%, pea: 27.9%), and compared with conventional application on average no yield ...Gravesen L (2003) The Treatment Frequency Index: an indicator for pesticide use and dependency as well as overall load on the environment. Reducing pesticide dependency in Europe to protect health, environment and biodiversity, Copenhagen, Pesticides Action Network Europe (PAN), Pure Conference.Among the recorded systems, herbicide treatment frequency index (HTFI) averaged over rotation increased when tillage frequency decreased. No recorded no-till system was herbicide-free. The untilled crops with the lowest HTFI (0.16) were unusual crops, i.e., relay grass-crops or multi-annual crops.Two indicators were used for the amount of herbicide applied: the total application rate and the treatment frequency index (SM Materials and Methods). LMM were analysed with a type III...Given a strongly right-skewed distribution, we log transformed application frequency. We adopted a common measure of pesticide intensity, the rate of application (Steinmann 2018), calculated as the amount of AI by extent of application (kg ha −1). Grouping by focal-field, pesticide class, and crop, we then summarized application ...Last Updated: 01 Oct 2023.

Pierson et al. (2007b) found an increase from 16% to 36% ground cover greatly reduced rill erosion in western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis Hooker) communities. Packer (1951) found 70% ground cover was about equal to 90% for control of overland flow and erosion on perennial wheatgrass sites on gradients of 33−66%. He suggested 70 ...Plant cover was estimated as the vertical projection of all above-ground organs such that the total vegetation cover may exceed 100%. The cover of flowering nectariferous plants and total ...First, by providing ground cover, plants reduced soil erosion rates dramatically. Second, by growing along stream margins, plants stabilized channel banks and defined a new relationship between stable streams and periodically inundated floodplains.The relationship between ground cover (%) and soil loss via surface erosion is significant and potentially non-linear, with rapid increases in surface erosion as ground cover falls below 30% ( Greene et al., 1994; Silburn et al., 2011 ).Crop improvement efforts are targeting increased above-ground biomass and radiation-use efficiency as drivers for greater yield. Early ground cover and canopy height contribute to biomass production, but manual measurements of these traits, and in particular above-ground biomass, are slow and labor-intensive, more so when made at multiple developmental stages. These constraints limit the ...Perennial groundcovers can improve vegetative cover in both annual and perennial cash-crop production. Incorporating low-growing, non-competitive (i.e. ecologically complementary) PGC into cash-crop fields restores continuous vegetative cover without interfering with cash-crop productivity ( Figure 1C ).Tradescantia fluminensis biomass increased dramatically at > 80% cover, with few native species able to persist at such high levels of invasion. Landscape context had almost no influence on...Maintaining ground cover is one of the most efficient ways of ensuring long-term sustainability of rangelands via soil conservation as 1) ground cover plays a direct role on the condition and trend of soils and 2) ground cover may be directly affected through land management activities including grazing ( Bates et al. 2009; Bork et al. 2012 ).Hay harvest had a strong negative effect on bare-ground cover (P = < 0.001, Supplementary Table S4): bare ground increased from 4.2 ± 0.85% in no hay harvested plots to 21.0 ± 1.70% in hay ...Cover can be measured for the entire vegetation in an area (e.g., "total vegetative cover was 45%"), or can be applied to individual species (e.g., "sagebrush cover was 10 to 15%"). Four Types of Cover. Basal Cover = The proportion of the plant that extends into the soil. Compared to other estimates of cover, basal cover is:

Abstract Phyllochron KeywordsBiophysical crop models convert GDD accumulation to leaf numbers by using a constant parameter termed phyllochron (°C-day leaf −1) or leaf appearance rate (LAR; leaf o C-day −1 ). However, such important parameter values are rarely estimated for modern maize hybrids.The average rate of leaf tip appearance was 0.022 leaf (°C d) −1; the plastochron was 45.7 °C d per leaf. The thermal duration of leaf expansion, i.e. the horizontal distance between leaf tip appearance and ligule appearance ( Fig. 1 a), depended on leaf number, but was not systematically affected by N supply and did not differ ...Results indicated that new 111-day hybrids produce leaves faster than old hybrids throughout the vegetative phase (7.4% and 3.1% faster before and after the ninth leaf stage, respectively), whereas new 103-day hybrids produce leaves faster only after the ninth leaf stage (9.4%).... The ALN on a stem or plant is associated with the leaf area expansion, and this is due to the interception of solar radiation, photosynthesis and accumulation of biomass by the crop (Streck...Plant height, plant leaf area, leaf number per plant, individual leaf area and dry weight, stem diameter, specific leaf weight (SLW), and leaf weight ratio (LWR) in bell pepper as a function of ...This study has been designed to estimate leaf lifespan, leaf production ( Lp) and leaf death ( Ld) rates, the age structure of leaves, and the decline in maximum photosynthetic rate ( Amax) with age in plants of Ipomoea pes-caprae growing with a full supply of nutrients and with a low Ca supply.From the emergence to the V10 stage, leaf collar emergence occurs at ∼29.5 °C d per leaf for upper leaves (the 13 th and higher), and LCA is ∼10 °C d/leaf (Wuethrich, 1997). The leaf-appearance rates are 61.7 °C d per leaf for the first through 12 th leaves and 35.3 °Cd per leaf for the 13 th and higher leaves (Muchow and ...Biophysical crop models convert GDD accumulation to leaf numbers by using a constant parameter termed phyllochron (°C-day leaf -1) or leaf appearance rate (LAR; leaf o C-day -1 ).

In addition to cover crop traits, in the weed control trials, we assessed two weed control efficiency indices in terms of weed ground cover (WCE COV) and biomass (WCE DM). Like for cover crop traits, a mean ground cover index for weed over time (COV Weed) was calculated in each plot in each trial.While cover crops reduced weed ground cover and dry mass by 60% and 68% on average in summer and winter, respectively, a higher number of cover crop species within a mixture did not increase mean weed control. Nonetheless, weed control was influenced by the mixture composition and improved when including Guizotia abyssinica.Weed control efficiency represents efficiency of weeds control by treatments in comparison with weedy check. Highest weed control efficiency was recorded in weed free plot (T 8) i.e. 96.57 per cent followed by treatment (T 4) Pendimethalin 30% EC @ 1kg a.i./ha (PE) + Imazethapyr 10% SL @ 100g a.i./ha (PoE) 78.00%. Treatment (T 7) weedy check ...The most common methods of weed suppression by an actively growing cover crop include competition for limited plant growth resources that result in reduced weed biomass, seed production, and hence reductions in the addition of seeds to the soil seedbank.The thermal control of weeds is based on the use of fire, flaming, hot water, steam and freezing, which provide rapid weed control without leaving chemical residues in the soil and water. Moreover, thermal methods are selective towards the weeds, do not disturb the soil and, therefore, do not bring the buried seeds to the soil ...Weed index is the measure of the efficiency of a particular treatment when compared with a weed free treatment. It is expressed as percentage of yield potential under weed free. More...Here, we review services and disservices associated with weeds in annual agroecosystems and present two case studies from the United States to illustrate how weeds growing in fall-planted cover crops can provide ground cover, decrease potential soil losses, and effectively manage nitrogen. We argue that in certain circumstances ...Common cover crops for weed control could be classified in four-group bases taxonomy: cereals, legumes, non-legumes, and brassicaceae plants . One of the cereals, rye (Cereale secale L.), is most commonly used as a winter cover crop in soybean and corn as it provides reasonable weed control and yield .Physical weed control measures such as burning, flame weeding, and soil steaming can be used to effectively control weed emergence and growth through plant or seed exposure to high temperatures. An integrated approach incorporating soil steaming, cover crops, and mulching can result in reduced herbicide reliance and effective weed ...To reduce reliance on herbicides and maintain crop productivity, integrated weed management (IWM) seeks to optimize synergies between diverse sets of weed management practices combined at the cropping system scale. Nevertheless, data on weed community response to the long-term implementation of IWM practices remain scare. Here, we ...

Furthermore, it is ...A field study was conducted at CSIR-IHBT, Palampur, India during 2018 and 2019 to analyze the efficacy of herbicides in combination with manual weeding on weed control and the yield of wild marigold ( Tagetes minuta L).Total weed density prior to weed control ranged from 0.2 to 319.4 plants.m − 2 and averaged 39.2 plants.m − 2. Total weed density varied by cropping system ( Table 2 ), and was higher in the four IWM systems compared to the reference system, where weed density was very low (averaging 3.8 plants.m − 2 ).Weed control efficiency was assessed through the ratio of weed groundcover to maize groundcover development (GC weed) and dominant weed species development (DWS, presence-absence), also grouped by life form (DWS group ), related to the groundcover of each species over time.Weed control ‘events’ associated with objects in the relevant classes combine to define the weed management system; the level at which outcomes are predicted (weed abundance, diversity, yield loss and evolution of resistance). The competition of the crop canopy is defined by an additional class.

One way to estimate speed of emergence is to calculate the number of days to reach 50 percent emergence. An example for 100 plants/m 2 (i.e. 18 seeds/m of row as in the example above) is shown in the table above. In this example the number of days to 50 percent emergence is: [(50-39)/(61-39)] + 7 = 7.5 days.Over all years and locations of this study, the number of days from sowing to 50% seedling emergence (DSE) ranged from 5 to 39 and averaged 12.2. Assuming sowing depth was 5 cm, the DSSAT-CSM model underestimated DSE in 94% of the site-years and averaged 4.8 days less than the observations (Table 3 and Fig. 2).The results regarding the days to 50% seed germination (Figure 1 a) revealed that the seeds left untreated (control) germinated in a maximum (32.02) number of days. The seeds treated...Over all years and locations of this study, the number of days from sowing to 50% seedling emergence (DSE) ranged from 5 to 39 and averaged 12.2. Assuming sowing depth was 5 cm, the DSSAT-CSM model underestimated DSE in 94% of the site-years and averaged 4.8 days less than the observations ( Table 3 and Fig. 2 ).Half-maximal germination (G50) was the number of days after sowing needed to reach 50% of the total germination, estimated in this study through the interpolation of one day before and 1 day after 50% of total germination was achieved.... to emergence varied between 6 days for the 18 May 2002 sowing and 21 days for the 15 January 2002 sowing.

Maximum mean percentage emergence of each species was calculated from the mean number of seed sown. Seedlings were harvested 60 and 150 days after emergence. Harvesting of seedlings sown in March commenced on 1st June 2010, with the second harvest on 1st September 2010. May sown ...To evaluate the transgenerational effects of temperature stress on the progeny fitness, in vitro seed germination parameters, such as maximum seed germination, time to 50% seed germination, and seed germination rate were measured.In the rainfed condition, the results demonstrated a prolonged duration to reach 50% flowering with higher nitrogen (N) application rates. The application of 52.5–110 kg N ha −1 resulted in significantly higher seed yield, while lower (18 kg N ha −1) and higher (156 kg N ha −1) doses of N led to reduced seed yield. Under irrigation conditions, superior seed weights and maximum seed ...The maximum emergence decreased from about 80% to 50%–40% with delay in sowing after irrigation. Seedling vigour as measured by shoot dry weight at 43 days after planting followed the pattern of seedling emergence. An advantage of delayed sowing after irrigation was better control of weeds with cultivation before planting.

Plant height was measured five to nine times through each growing season. For IA15, plant height was measured using the plot canopy height until flag leaf fully expanded, then flag leaf height of a representative plant from each plot was used until flowering, and finally the panicle apex height measurements were used. For IA16, IA18 ...Relationship between flowering phenology and height growth pattern. Plant height increased progressively during the growing season for all the species, but their H max varied several fold, ranging from 25 to 150 cm among species (Appendix S1; see also Fig. 1).We defined the leaf length (L) as the longest extension from leaf apex to base (i.e. connection point of leaf blade and petiole). Leaf width (W) corresponds to the longest extension of any two points on the blade edge perpendicular to the leaf length axis, that is the axes connecting leaf apex and base (Shi et al., 2019a; see Fig. 1 ...At the organ or plant scale and over short time periods, growth is often used synonymously with tissue expansion, while over longer time periods the increase in biomass is a common metric.

From the viewpoint of global climate change mitigation, this stand fixed 4.14 Mg ha −1 and 13.93 Mg ha −1 of carbon units and CO 2 molecules into above-ground biomass, respectively.Relative growth rate (RGR), as defined by Watson (1952) in the following equation, was a more generalized expression of the efficiency index proposed by Blackman (1919): RGR = l/m dm/dt. The RGR equation required the additional assumption that crop mass increased as an inverse function of current crop mass.The radiation use efficiency (RUE) of crops is a measure of the conversion of intercepted radiation to biomass. It can be calculated as a function of PAR or solar radiation, using shoots or whole crops, and calculated as the ratio or slope of the regression between biomass and intercepted radiation.Radiation-use efficiency (RUE) is an index used to quantify the relationship between solar radiation and biomass, and crop yield can be increased by increasing RUE.

We ...Figures (1) Abstract and Figures Small-seeded plant species are often reported to have high relative growth rate or RGR. However, because RGR declines as plants grow larger, small-seeded...Under frequent disturbance (e.g. tropical grasslands), increased competition for light can be manifested strategically as an increased rate of height growth, or under lower disturbance frequency as increased ultimate height. Physiologically, the same conditions that are conducive to higher LAI (i.e. warm, high rainfall and nutrient ...The present study showed that plants in crowded stands regulate their height growth so as to maintain similar height to neighbours: plants whose top had been lowered relative to their neighbours accelerated the elongation rate while plants whose top had been lifted higher than the neighbours reduced the elongation rate (Fig. 2).

The main goals of this study were to initially investigate the effects of plant densities on the aboveground dry matter of corn, and subsequently examine the effects of plant densities on RUE and leaf area index (LAI), and the effects of LAI on RUE. Finally, we provide a comparative assessment of the approaches used to determine RUE.Across the 49 plots nested into 17 sites, measured aNPP ranged from 99 g dry mass m −2 year −1 in montane heath to a maximum of 1481 g dry mass m −2 year −1 in intensively managed lowland improved grassland (Fig. 2).

Biochar is the product of biomass pyrolysis and has been shown to reduce soil acidity, immobilize metal (loid)s and thus ameliorate plant growth.Overall, our findings are the first to indicate that an increase in organic fertilizer application rate does not necessarily boost antibiotic resistance in agricultural soils, and to define an organic fertilization rate threshold for the enrichment of soil ARGs. In particular, the threshold fertilization rate was 45 t/ha/y, however ...In the first day of incubation, biochar amendment reduced soil C mineralisation rates from 58 to 88% compared to the soil-alone as a function of increasing biochar application rates. This reduction was mainly attributed to the mineralisation of easily available substrates from incomplete pyrolysis, which were preferentially used by ...Biochar application rates from 0.5 to 135 t ha −1 have produced plant growth responses ranging from −29% to 324% [ 12 ]. Plant and soil responses of biochar application also varied with agricultural systems, crop type, climatic conditions [ 13, 14 ], and fertilization status [ 15 ].The increase in CEC is soil-dependent and modulated by high-ash biochar CEC and application rate, as well as by the original soil CEC. The addition of alkaline and high-cation exchange capacity (CEC) biochars is a suitable strategy to increase the CEC of weathered soils.Five treatments were tested: clear cultivation (CC, bare soil without mulching) and four MB application rates of 0.37, 0.74, 1.11, and 1.48 kg m –2. The application of MB reduced runoff generation by 15.5 to 78.6% and sediment yield by 40.7 to 98.6% compared to CC.The resulting sulfur-enriched biochar (SulfaChar) and synthetic S fertiliser (control treatment) were amended to potting soils and the growth response of corn (Zea mays L.) and soybeans [Glycine...

Soil Organic Carbon Content Soil organic carbon, the major component of soil organic matter, is extremely important in all soil processes. Organic material in the soil is essentially derived from residual plant and animal material, synthesised by microbes and decomposed under the influence of temperature, moisture and ambient soil conditions.Soil Organic Carbon. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is one of the most important characteristics of soils that result from the interplay of net primary producers, decomposers, and mineralogy.

Phosphorus is the second most important crop nutrient after Nitrogen. It is an essential macronutrient that plays important role in all crop biochemical processes such as photosynthesis,...For surface and subsurface soils, the mean percentages of WEP, CCEP, and OEP relative to the total were 0.38, 0.32, 4.3, 0.33, 0.33, and 3.68%, respectively. This implies that only a small amount of total P in soils is available and that fractions of WEP and OEP in surface soils were larger than in subsurface soils.Abstract. The fate of phosphorus (P) derived from mineral fertilisers and organic manures, and the effective P balance, have been assessed in three long-term field experiments at Rothamsted (UK), Bad Lauchstaedt (Germany) and Skierniewice (Poland). This paper discusses the plant availability, uptake and overall utilisation of P over the last 30 ...Phosphorus is a fundamental nutrient for primary productivity of ecosystems and agricultural production, but its misuse impacts agricultural sustainability and has important environmental consequences.

Leaf nitrogen content (LNC), an indicator for the amount of photosynthetic proteins, plays an important role to understand plant function and status. In previous studies, vegetation indices (VIs) have been demonstrated to monitor LNC non-destructively, but which is influenced by backgrounds, and lacks specificity for nitrogen stress.Plants invest a considerable amount of leaf nitrogen in the photosynthetic enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO), forming a strong coupling of nitrogen and...Higher N content in leaves is associated with higher chlorophyll content and increased chloroplast activity and thus increased photosynthetic productivity. Conclusions: It is possible to...Here, we investigated the content of nitrogen and phosphorus in leaves of different life forms. Leaf P was higher in herb species than in shrub and tree species, while leaf N in shrubs was higher than in herbs and trees (Fig. 1; Fig. 2). The content of N and P in plant leaves showed a significant change across an elevation gradient ...Nitrogen (N) is an essential element required in actively growing tissue for healthy plant growth. It is a component of proteins, chlorophyll, and numerous other organic compounds. N deficiency causes dramatic reductions in plant growth and chlorophyll synthesis, resulting in paleness and yellowing of the leaf (chlorosis).Nitrogen is an essential macronutrient for plants, where its availability is a determinant of plant productivity (Chen et al. ) are the two major forms of N that are absorbed by plants; however, both forms are in short supply in agricultural and natural ecosystems (Crawford and Forde ).Approximately, 30–50% of nitrogen in green leaves is in the form of D-ribulose 1–5-diphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO) (Kokaly, 2001), being the key photosynthetic enzyme/protein in green leaves (Gutteridge and Gatenby, 1995, Andersson and Backlund, 2008).Nitrogen deficiency is characterized by poor plant growth and pale yellow leaves due to insufficient chlorophyll content and some environmental stresses . Nitrogen is a key component of the chlorophyll that intensifies photosynthesis in crops [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ], and plant yield is affected by irregularity in nitrogen content [ 8 , 9 ...Leaf area growth and nitrogen concentration per unit leaf area, N a (g m −2 N) are two options plants can use to adapt to nitrogen limitation. Previous work indicated that potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) adapts the size of leaves to maintain N a and photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf area.This paper reports on the effect of N limitation on leaf area production and photosynthetic capacity in ...

It is well known that phosphorus deficiency in plants disturbs the production of chlorophyll, causing leaf chlorosis [ 7, 8 ]. Prolonged P deficiency may further result in the accumulation of anthocyanins, consequently leading to purple discolouration on the leaf surface [ 9, 10 ].It is found that soil thickness on mainland is higher than on islands, while its soil maximum water content is lower on mainland than on islands; Other facts include: soil total phosphorus(P)...Leaf phosphorus (P) comprises four major fractions; inorganic phosphate (Pi), nucleic acids, phospholipids, P‐containing metabolites and a residual fraction.Depending on the plant species, it is estimated that the content of phosphorus derived from phytate ranges from 30 to 60% of the total phosphorus in seeds. It is generally assumed that the major role of Ins P6 in plants is to act as a storage form for Pi, but these compounds also have other physiological roles other than P6 storage ...Commentary As fundamental plant nutrients, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) exert strong controls on the metabolic performance of leaves.Here, we investigated the content of nitrogen and phosphorus in leaves of different life forms.

Determination of Total Potassium Content in Plants. The total potassium content in leaves was determined using a H 2 SO 4-H 2 O 2 flame photometer . Fresh leaves were dried at 85°C for 30 min and then at 105°C until reaching a constant weight.Potassium (K) is an essential element for regulating plant growth and physiological metabolism. However, little information is available on large-scale spatial variations in leaf potassium concentrations (LKC) in different plant species, the variations in LKC, and the mechanism underlying these variations. Here, we measured LKC in ...Mohammad Sarraf g , Mirza Hasanuzzaman h Add to Mendeley https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2022.01.001 Get rights and content • Potassium has diverse role in plant growth and development. • Potassium is responsible for activation of several vital plant enzymes. •Abstract. Potassium (K) is one of three main crop nutrients, and the high rate of potash fertilizer utilization (second only to nitrogen) leads to high prices. Therefore, efficient application, as well as rapid and time monitoring of K in crops is essential. Several turnover box and field experiments were conducted across multiple ...Potassium content in the roots, stems, and leaves of seedlings increased with the increasing in K supply . The K content of all organs was the highest under K12 treatment. In K0 and K3 treatments, the K content of each organ was the highest in leaves, second-highest in the stems, and lowest in roots. Under the other K level ...Changes in the potassium content would unavoidably have an impact on reflectance since there is a direct relationship between potassium content and the color, structure, and moisture content of plant leaves [5,16,17,18,19], which has been confirmed in many related studies.Potassium is the most abundant inorganic cation in non‐halophytes, contributing up to 6 % of plant dry weight. As a major inorganic osmolyte, K + is crucial for cell osmoregulation and turgor maintenance and, hence, for cell expansion, stomatal function, tropisms and leaf movement.Potassium (K) is the most abundant inorganic cation, and it is important for ensuring optimal plant growth ( White and Karley, 2010 ). K is an activator of dozens of important enzymes, such as protein synthesis, sugar transport, N and C metabolism, and photosynthesis.Last Updated: 12 Jun 2023.

Eucalyptus are widely planted in regions with low rainfall, occasioning frequent drought stresses. To alleviate the stress-induced effects on plants growing in these environments, soil fertilization with potassium (K) may affect drought-adaptive plant mechanisms, notably on tropical soils with low K availability.

A proposed model for calcium distribution and water flow within leaves It has been demonstrated that both the rate and the concentration at which Ca 2+ in the transpiration stream is delivered to leaves are likely to be affected by the pathway of water flow to and through leaves.INTRODUCTION Calcium is an essential plant nutrient. As the divalent cation (Ca 2+ ), it is required for structural roles in the cell wall and membranes, as a counter‐cation for inorganic and organic anions in the vacuole, and as an intracellular messenger in the cytosol ( Marschner, 1995 ).In general, calcium deficiency as a result of low soil availability is not very common ( White and Broadley, 2003 ). Deficiency symptoms occur however more often in developing tissue such as young leaves and fruits, due to low remobilization from old to young tissue via the phloem.Various fractions of calcium were qualified in the young and mature leaves as well as tuber tissue. A reduced concentration of water soluble fraction of calcium was most important factor related to the development of calcium deficiency symptoms in the line overexpressing sCAX1.Content of insoluble Ca is lowest in the growing leaves of «low Ca» plants (0.1%) and highest in the adult leaves of «high Ca» plants (0.8 %). The amount of calcium oxalate is lowest in the «low Ca» plants Figure 4. Dry weight per cm 2 leaf blade area.It has been reported that calcium provided a larger number of leaves and ... The results showed that calcium foliar application led to an increase in vitamin C content and calcium content in ...Calcium content in plants ranges between 0.005 to 5% of dry weight, depending on the plant species, tissue type, and environmental conditions (Jones and Lunt, 1967; Demarty et al., 1984; Thor, 2019); 60-75% of calcium is localized in cell walls (Rossignol et al., 1977; Demarty et al., 1984; Pegg et al., 2019).Changes in the nutrient concentrations in roots, trunks, canes, and leaves of Ca 2+ -deficient and Ca 2+ -sufficient grapevines. The nutrient concentrations, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and B ...Total N content was determined by the micro Kjeldahls’ method. Total K concentration in the leaf was analysed using the flame-photometric method. The calcium content (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) content were determined using an atomic absorption spectrometer (Spektr AA 800, Varian, CA, USA). Statistical analysesInternal distributions of Ca and Mg were determined in transverse leaf sections at the base and apex of leaves using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) with cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM).

Manganese (Mn) is an important micronutrient for plant growth and development and sustains metabolic roles within different plant cell compartments. The metal is an essential cofactor for the oxygen-evolving complex of the photosynthetic machinery, catalyzing the water-splitting reaction in photosystem II (PSII). Despite the ...Introduction—Manganese as an Essential Plant Nutrient. Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient in most organisms. More than 200 years ago, the presence of Mn in leaf tissue of plants was experimentally documented for the first time in the ash of several vegetable species [ 1 ].In this study, we obtained the first direct measurements of the speciation of Mn in the leaves of the Mn-hyperaccumulator P. acinosa leaves using XAS. Results showed that Mn in leaves was bivalent and that almost 90% of the total Mn was Mn-oxalate. The XAS method is based on linear fitting of combinations of the near-edge spectra of ...Manganese toxicity in plants can cause stunting, chlorosis, curled leaves, or brown lesions, as well as inhibiting photosynthesis and respiration. Several elements such as P and Ca are reported...Currently, it is assumed that the average global Mn content is between 450 and 4000 mg Mn⋅kg −1 (Li et al., 2019 ). Similar values, from 100 to 4000 mg Mn⋅kg −1, were provided by Helmke in ( 2000 ).The main aim of our study was to determine the content of copper, manganese, zinc, and cadmium in tea leaves and to find out if there are any significant differences among the teas of different types and countries of their origin.The distribution of Mn in the leaves of P. acinosa was controlled mainly by the transpiration rate. Our investigation demonstrated that Mn was readily transported from the roots to shoots of P. acinosa but that it could not be remobilized readily after it reached leaves. Article PDF ReferencesThe total Chl content in the leaves also decreased under Mn-toxic conditions (Fig. 3b). These results indicated that Mn toxicity causes PSII photoinhibition.In roots and in young leaves, Mn accumulated to higher levels in Fe plants than in control plants, while this was not observed in P- or Mn-starved plants exposed to high Mn. In old leaves, by contrast, there was a lower accumulation of Mn in P-deprived plants than in controls. After the Mn shock, similar Mn concentrations were ...Micro-PIXE analysis of cross sections of tea leaves revealed that (i) epidermis contains the largest concentrations of Mg, oxalate crystals contain most of Ca and epidermises and oxalate crystals of Mn, ii) there is a leaf-age effect on tissue-specific concentration of Mg, Ca and Mn with all tissues of old leaves containing larger Mg ...

This suggests that high soluble sugar concentration in the stem of TS is due to a factor other than the small panicle caused by the sp1 mutation. Therefore, in the present study, we characterized sugar metabolism in the stem of TS to obtain clues to the cause of its high sugar concentration.We calculated the allocation of soluble sugar and starch to leaf, stem and roots by multiplying the concentration by organ biomass and dividing by the total soluble sugar and starch biomass in each organ biomass by the whole-plant soluble sugar and starch biomass.In large seedlings, −WC treatment significantly decreased leaf soluble sugar concentration and leaf starch concentration by 40%, when compared to +WC treatment (p < 0.05; Figures 5C,D), and −WDE treatment significantly increased stem and root soluble sugar concentrations, by 69 and 92%, respectively, when compared with the +WDE ...Owing to the changes in the stems of transgenic and WT plants, the soluble sugar (fructose, glucose, and sucrose) and starch concentrations in the T 3 generation of OE11b-1, RNAi11b-5, and WT plants were analyzed (Figs. 7 and 8). OE11b-1 lines had remarkably higher sugar concentrations in their leaves, and their glucose, fructose ...Sensing intracellular soluble sugar pathways, however, provides incomplete information about the metabolic status of plant cells, since they ignore the concentration of soluble sugars in the apoplast and, perhaps more importantly, the apoplast-cytosol and the vacuole-cytosol fluxes of sugars. Consequently, a complex signalling network underlying to sugar-sensing pathways is present.Soluble sugar helps in maintaining the leaf water content and osmotic adjustment of plants subjected to drought stress (Xu et al., 2007). However, decreased utilization of sugar due to restriction of growth may also cause accumulation of sugars in leaves ( Hummel et al., 2010 ).The whole-seedling soluble sugar content was calculated as the sum of fructose, glucose and sucrose in carious tissues, and the NSC pool was obtained by summing up the contents of soluble sugars and starch. The soluble sugar concentrations were measured using 0.2 g of dry mass. Sugars were extracted in 2 mL of 80% v/v ethanol ...Sweet sorghum is able to accumulate remarkable amount of soluble sugars in the stem while ensuring grain filling and for this reason can be used as a dual purpose crop (Rutto et al. 2013 ). Sugar production by sweet sorghum depends on the quantity of sweet juice contained in the stem.Xu et al. (Citation 2015) found that drought stress condition significantly increased soluble sugar concentration in roots and leaves of susceptible rice variety but not in resistant one. In contrast, stem soluble sugar concentration in both susceptible and tolerant genotypes was significantly reduced under drought stress (Xu et al., Citation ...Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) include soluble sugars and starch. These NSCs provide the main energy supply for plant growth, development and reproduction, and perform important functions in...
